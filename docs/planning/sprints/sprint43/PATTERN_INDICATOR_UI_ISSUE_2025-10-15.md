# Pattern/Indicator UI Display Issue - Diagnosis

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Location**: TickStockPL (Producer) - Event Publishing

---

## Issue Summary

**Symptoms**:
1. **Patterns**: Showing in UI but delayed (8-10 minutes instead of minute 1-2)
2. **Indicators**: NOT showing in UI at all

**Database Status**: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
- `intraday_patterns`: 680 AlwaysDetected + 671 PriceChange patterns detected
- `intraday_indicators`: 690 AlwaysTrue + 418 SMA5 + 418 SMA_5 indicators calculated
- Data is being written to TimescaleDB successfully

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

1. **TickStockPL Data Processing** ✅
   - Patterns ARE being detected (1,351 total patterns in last 30 min)
   - Indicators ARE being calculated (1,526 total indicators in last 30 min)
   - Database writes ARE working correctly

2. **TickStockPL Redis Publishing** ✅
   - Publishing to `tickstock:patterns:streaming` ✅
   - Publishing to `tickstock:patterns:detected` ✅
   - Publishing to `tickstock:indicators:streaming` ✅

3. **TickStockAppV2 Redis Subscription** ✅
   - Subscribed to all correct channels ✅
   - Event handlers configured correctly ✅

### ❌ What's Broken

#### Issue #1: Indicator Events Missing `symbol` Field

**Evidence** (from Redis monitoring):
```
20:39:28.236 | tickstock:indicators:streaming | streaming_indicator | N/A | Indicator: N/A
20:39:28.269 | tickstock:indicators:streaming | streaming_indicator | N/A | Indicator: N/A
20:39:28.301 | tickstock:indicators:streaming | streaming_indicator | N/A | Indicator: N/A
```

**Pattern events (WORKING correctly)**:
```
20:39:28.339 | tickstock:patterns:streaming | streaming_pattern | NVDA | Pattern: PriceChange, Conf: 0.95
20:39:28.372 | tickstock:patterns:streaming | streaming_pattern | NVDA | Pattern: AlwaysDetected, Conf: 0.85
```

**Diagnosis**:
- TickStockPL is publishing indicator events to Redis ✅
- BUT the event structure is missing the `symbol` field ❌
- TickStockAppV2 cannot display indicators without knowing which symbol they apply to

**TickStockPL Code Issue**:
The indicator event publisher in TickStockPL needs to include the `symbol` field in the Redis message payload.

Expected structure:
```json
{
  "type": "streaming_indicator",
  "symbol": "NVDA",              // ← MISSING
  "indicator_type": "AlwaysTrue",
  "value": 1.0,
  "timestamp": 1729042768.236,
  "timeframe": "1min"
}
```

---

#### Issue #2: Pattern Delay (8-10 minutes)

**Hypothesis**: Not a real-time publishing issue (events ARE published immediately)

**Possible Causes**:
1. **UI buffering delay** - TickStockAppV2's `StreamingBuffer` may be holding events too long
2. **WebSocket delivery delay** - Events reaching browser but UI not updating
3. **Browser JavaScript issue** - Pattern display component not rendering real-time
4. **Event filtering** - Pattern alert manager filtering out early patterns

**Next Steps** (for TickStockAppV2):
- Check `StreamingBuffer` flush interval (should be 250ms, not 8-10 minutes)
- Verify WebSocket `emit()` calls are happening in real-time
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify pattern alert manager is not blocking early detections

## Recommended Fixes

### FIX #1: TickStockPL - Add `symbol` to Indicator Events (CRITICAL)

**File**: TickStockPL streaming indicator publisher
**Change**: Include `symbol` field in Redis event payload

**Before** (current - BROKEN):
```python
indicator_event = {
    'type': 'streaming_indicator',
    'indicator_type': indicator_name,
    'value': indicator_value,
    'timestamp': timestamp
}
```

**After** (REQUIRED):
```python
indicator_event = {
    'type': 'streaming_indicator',
    'symbol': symbol,  # ← ADD THIS
    'indicator_type': indicator_name,
    'value': indicator_value,
    'timestamp': timestamp,
    'timeframe': '1min'
}
```

---

### FIX #2: TickStockAppV2 - Check StreamingBuffer Flush Interval

**File**: `src/core/services/streaming_buffer.py`

**Current Configuration** (from .env):
```bash
STREAMING_BUFFER_ENABLED=true
STREAMING_BUFFER_INTERVAL=250  # Should be 250ms
STREAMING_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE=100
```

**Verification Needed**:
1. Is buffer actually flushing every 250ms?
2. Is buffer size limit of 100 being exceeded?
3. Are patterns being buffered for 8-10 minutes?

**Debug Steps**:
```python
# Add logging to streaming_buffer.py
logger.info(f"Buffer flush triggered - {len(buffer)} events, age: {buffer_age_ms}ms")
```

## Test Results

### Redis Event Monitoring (15-second test)

**Results**:
- Total events: 200+
- Pattern events: 54 on `tickstock:patterns:streaming`, 52 on `tickstock:patterns:detected`
- Indicator events: 84 on `tickstock:indicators:streaming`

**Pattern Event Example** (WORKING):
```
Symbol: NVDA
Pattern: AlwaysDetected
Confidence: 0.85
Timestamp: 20:39:28.372
```

**Indicator Event Example** (BROKEN - Missing Symbol):
```
Symbol: N/A  ←  PROBLEM
Indicator: N/A
```

## Action Items

### For TickStockPL Team (CRITICAL - BLOCKS UI)

- [ ] **FIX**: Add `symbol` field to indicator event Redis messages
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Test that indicator events include symbol in Redis
- [ ] **DEPLOY**: Update TickStockPL streaming indicator publisher

### For TickStockAppV2 (INVESTIGATE)

- [ ] **CHECK**: StreamingBuffer flush interval (250ms target)
- [ ] **CHECK**: Pattern display component JavaScript
- [ ] **CHECK**: WebSocket delivery logs for patterns
- [ ] **CHECK**: Pattern alert manager filtering logic

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Database (✅ WORKING)
```sql
-- Patterns detected (last 30 min)
SELECT COUNT(*), pattern_type FROM intraday_patterns
WHERE detection_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'
GROUP BY pattern_type;

-- Indicators calculated (last 30 min)
SELECT COUNT(*), indicator_type FROM intraday_indicators
WHERE calculation_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'
GROUP BY indicator_type;
```

### Monitor Redis Events (✅ EVENTS PUBLISHING)
```bash
python scripts/diagnostics/check_redis_pattern_events.py
```

### Check TickStockAppV2 Logs
```bash
# Look for pattern broadcasts
grep "REDIS-SUBSCRIBER.*streaming_pattern" logs/tickstock.log

# Look for indicator broadcasts
grep "REDIS-SUBSCRIBER.*streaming_indicator" logs/tickstock.log
```

---

## Conclusion

**Primary Issue**: TickStockPL indicator events are missing the `symbol` field in Redis messages.

**Secondary Issue**: Pattern delay (8-10 min) needs investigation in TickStockAppV2's buffering/display logic.

**Database**: ✅ Working perfectly - all data is being written correctly.

**Redis Pub-Sub**: ✅ Working - events are being published and TickStockAppV2 is subscribed.

**UI**: ❌ Cannot display indicators without symbol field from TickStockPL.

---

**Next Step**: Update TickStockPL indicator event publisher to include `symbol` field, then re-test UI.
