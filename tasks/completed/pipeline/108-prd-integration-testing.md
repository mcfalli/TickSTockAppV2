# Sprint 108 PRD: Integration & Testing

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint focuses on the final integration of all multi-channel architecture components from Sprints 103-107 and comprehensive testing of the complete system. The goal is to ensure the new multi-channel processing system works seamlessly together, meets performance requirements, maintains data integrity, and is ready for production deployment with the big-bang architectural change.

**Problem Statement:** With all individual components of the multi-channel architecture implemented, we need to integrate them into a cohesive system, conduct comprehensive testing to validate functionality and performance, and ensure the big-bang deployment will be successful without the need for backward compatibility.

## Goals

1. **Complete System Integration**: Connect all channel components with existing TickStock infrastructure
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Execute full test suite covering unit, integration, and system-level scenarios
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify system meets target performance metrics with all three channel types
4. **Data Integrity Verification**: Ensure no data loss or corruption through the new processing pipeline
5. **Production Readiness**: Validate system is ready for big-bang deployment without rollback capability

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Coverage
- **Target**: 90% code coverage for all new channel components
- **Focus**: Individual channel processing logic, configuration management, error handling
- **Tools**: Pytest with coverage reporting

## Technical Considerations

### Big-Bang Deployment Requirements
- No gradual migration or A/B testing capability needed
- Complete replacement of linear processing with multi-channel system
- No fallback to previous architecture required
- Full system restart expected during deployment

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Channel-specific metrics must be observable
- Performance degradation alerts for each channel type
- Error rate monitoring across all channels
- Resource utilization tracking for memory and CPU

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Channel isolation prevents single channel failure from affecting others
- Graceful degradation when individual channels fail
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for persistent failures

### Data Validation
- End-to-end data integrity checks
- Event format validation at channel boundaries
- Source context preservation verification
- WebSocket client compatibility validation

## Success Metrics

1. **Integration Completeness**: 100% of multi-channel components integrated and functional
2. **Performance Targets Met**: All performance benchmarks achieved (8k symbols, <50ms latency, <2GB memory)
3. **Test Coverage**: 90% unit test coverage, 100% integration scenario coverage
4. **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss or corruption detected in end-to-end testing
5. **WebSocket Compatibility**: Existing WebSocket clients work without modification
6. **Deployment Readiness**: System passes all production readiness checks

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: All channel components, router, integration points
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-channel scenarios, event flow, WebSocket publishing

- **Regression Tests**: Existing functionality preservation

### Manual Testing Scenarios

## Open Questions

1. What is the rollback strategy if critical issues are discovered post-deployment?
2. How should we handle data migration for any stateful components during deployment?
3. What monitoring and alerting thresholds should be set for production operation?
