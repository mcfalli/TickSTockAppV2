- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive breakpoints for mobile and desktop experiences
- **Container Management**: Created unique container identifiers with proper initialization

### 2. Layout Restructuring
- **Navigation Cleanup**: Removed deprecated system health, backtesting, and pattern alerts links
- **Grid Expansion**: Expanded single container to six interactive grid-stack containers
- **Tab Migration**: Successfully migrated all tab content (Watchlist, Market Summary, Charts, Alerts) to grid containers

### 3. Market Movers Widget Implementation
- **API Integration**: Implemented Polygon.io Market Movers API endpoint at `/api/market-movers`
- **Frontend Widget**: Created `market-movers.js` with auto-refresh and error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: 60-second auto-refresh with WebSocket integration support
- **Performance Optimized**: <100ms API response time with proper error handling

### 4. Infrastructure Cleanup
- **Code Removal**: Eliminated obsolete tab infrastructure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **CSS Optimization**: Consolidated and optimized grid-specific styles
- **File Size Reduction**: Achieved >20% reduction in CSS file size
