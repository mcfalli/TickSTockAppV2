3. [Configuration Best Practices](#configuration-best-practices)
4. [Real Examples Analysis](#real-examples-analysis)
5. [Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)
6. [Testing Your Agent](#testing-your-agent)

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
**Each agent should excel at ONE domain**
```yaml
# GOOD: Focused expertise
name: "redis-integration-specialist"
description: "Redis pub-sub architecture specialist for event publishing"

# BAD: Too broad
name: "backend-specialist"
description: "Handles all backend tasks"
```

### 2. Clear Boundaries
**Define what the agent WILL and WON'T do**
```markdown
## Scope
- ✅ WILL: Redis pub-sub patterns, event publishing, channel management
- ❌ WON'T: Database operations, UI code, consumer patterns
```

### 3. Specific Tool Requirements
**List exact tools needed, not generic categories**
```yaml
# GOOD: Specific tools
tools: "Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, TodoWrite"

# BAD: Vague
tools: "All development tools"
```

## Agent Structure Template

### Optimal Agent File Structure
```markdown
---
name: "[domain]-[specialty]-specialist"
description: "[One-line description of expertise]"
tools: "[Specific tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, etc.]"
color: "[Choose: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple]"
---

    """Explain why this is wrong"""
    pass
```

## Integration Points
- **Prerequisite Agents**: [Agent that should run before]
- **Handoff Agents**: [Agent that should run after]
- **Collaboration Agents**: [Agents to work with in parallel]

## Success Metrics
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]

## Example Prompts
```
User: "Create a Redis event publisher"
Response: I'll implement a Redis event publisher following these steps...
[Show exactly how the agent would respond]
```
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Make It Scannable
Agents are selected by AI based on descriptions. Make key information immediately visible:

```markdown
# GOOD: Scannable structure
## Expertise Areas
### Performance Optimization
- Sub-millisecond pattern detection (<1ms requirement)
- Vectorized operations (66x performance improvement proven)
- Memory management (2.8GB usage optimization)

# BAD: Buried in paragraphs
This agent handles various performance tasks including optimization of pattern detection to achieve sub-millisecond performance...
```

### 2. Include Concrete Examples
Show EXACTLY what the agent can do:

```markdown
## Example Tasks I Excel At

### Task: "Optimize pattern detection performance"
```python
# BEFORE: 66ms average
for candle in data:
    if check_pattern(candle):
        patterns.append(candle)

# AFTER: 1ms average (66x improvement)
mask = vectorized_check(data)
patterns = data[mask]
```

### Result: 66x performance improvement using vectorization
```

### 3. Define Clear Triggers
Specify WHEN the agent should be used:

```markdown
## Activation Triggers
Use this agent when:
1. Performance is below targets (<1ms pattern, <50ms database)
2. Memory usage exceeds limits (>4GB)
3. User mentions: "optimize", "slow", "performance", "memory"
4. Test failures mention: "timeout", "performance assertion"
```

### 4. Provide Decision Trees
Help the AI choose the right approach:

```markdown
## Decision Framework

### Pattern Detection Optimization
```
Is it a single pattern?
├── YES: Use vectorized operations
│   └── Expected improvement: 10-100x
└── NO: Is it multiple patterns?
    ├── YES: Use parallel processing
    │   └── Expected improvement: 3-5x
    └── NO: Profile first to identify bottleneck
```
```

### 5. Include Domain-Specific Knowledge
Embed expertise that generic AI might not have:

```markdown
## TickStock-Specific Optimizations

### Database Query Patterns
- **OHLCV queries**: Always use TimescaleDB hypertables
- **Pattern queries**: Index on (symbol, timestamp) for 50x speedup
- **Batch inserts**: Use COPY for >1000 rows (10x faster than INSERT)

### Redis Event Publishing
- **Batch threshold**: 100 events before flush
- **Channel naming**: tickstock:[domain]:[event_type]
- **Serialization**: MessagePack for 3x size reduction
```

## Real Examples Analysis

### Highly Effective Agent Example
From `tickstock-test-specialist.md`:

**Why it works:**
1. **Clear expertise**: "Expert testing specialist for TickStock"
2. **Specific tools**: Lists exact tools needed
3. **Proven patterns**: Shows 637+ tests created
4. **Concrete examples**: Includes actual test code
5. **Success metrics**: "<1ms pattern detection" measurable

### Less Effective Agent Example
Generic "code-helper" agent:

**Why it's weak:**
1. **Vague purpose**: "Helps with code"
2. **No specialization**: Tries to do everything
3. **No examples**: Just descriptions
4. **No metrics**: Can't measure success

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Broad Scope
```markdown
# BAD: Trying to do everything
"This agent handles all Python development tasks including testing, optimization, documentation, deployment..."

# GOOD: Focused expertise
"This agent specializes in pytest-based integration testing for Redis pub-sub systems with <100ms latency requirements"
```

### 2. Missing Context
```markdown
# BAD: No project context
"Optimizes database queries"

# GOOD: Project-specific
"Optimizes TimescaleDB queries for TickStock OHLCV data with 1ms retrieval target"
```

### 3. No Success Criteria
```markdown
# BAD: Vague goals
"Makes code better"

# GOOD: Measurable outcomes
"Achieves <1ms pattern detection, <50ms database operations, <100ms Redis publishing"
```

### 4. Missing Prerequisites
```markdown
# BAD: No dependencies listed
"Implements patterns"

# GOOD: Clear prerequisites
"Requires: BasePattern class exists, Redis connection configured, pytest installed"
```

## Testing Your Agent

### 1. Clarity Test
Can another developer understand:
- What the agent does?
- When to use it?
- What it won't do?
- How to verify success?

### 2. Specificity Test
Count the specific, measurable claims:
- Performance targets (ms, MB, %)
- Code examples (actual snippets)
- Tool requirements (exact names)
- Success metrics (measurable outcomes)

**Target: At least 10 specific claims per agent**

### 3. Integration Test
- Does it reference other agents correctly?
- Are handoff points clear?
- Is the workflow documented?

### 4. Practical Test
Give the agent a real task and verify:
- It stays within scope
- It uses specified approaches
- It achieves stated metrics
- It hands off appropriately

## Agent Configuration Checklist

Before deploying an agent, verify:

## Example: Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Define the Need
"We need better database migration handling"

### Step 2: Scope the Expertise
```yaml
name: "database-migration-specialist"
description: "PostgreSQL migration specialist for TickStock schema evolution"
tools: "Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep"
color: "blue"
```

### Step 3: Build the Framework
```markdown
## Primary Mission
Ensure zero-downtime PostgreSQL schema migrations for TickStock's financial data tables while maintaining data integrity and performance targets.

## Expertise Areas
### Migration Strategies
- Online migrations using pg_repack
- Partition management for time-series data
- Index optimization without blocking

### Safety Mechanisms
- Rollback procedures for every migration
- Data validation checksums
- Performance impact assessment
```

### Step 4: Add Concrete Examples
```sql
-- Example: Adding index without blocking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_patterns_timestamp
ON patterns(symbol, timestamp)
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Step 5: Define Success
```markdown
## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
- [ ] Query performance maintained (<50ms)
- [ ] Rollback tested and documented
- [ ] No data loss or corruption
```

## Final Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Redis pub-sub" not "messaging"
2. **Show Results**: "66x faster" not "improved performance"
3. **Include Code**: Real examples, not descriptions
4. **Set Boundaries**: What it won't do is as important as what it will
5. **Measure Success**: If you can't measure it, you can't improve it
6. **Project Context**: Always reference actual project components
7. **Update Regularly**: As patterns prove successful, add them to agents
