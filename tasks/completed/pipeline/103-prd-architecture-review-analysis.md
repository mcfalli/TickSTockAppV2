# Sprint 103 PRD: Architecture Review & Analysis

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the current TickStock linear processing architecture to identify refactoring opportunities for implementing a multi-channel processing system. The goal is to provide maintenance clarity and establish the foundation for a scalable, parallel processing architecture that can handle multiple data types (Tick, OHLCV, FMV) efficiently.

**Problem Statement:** The current linear pipeline processes all market data through a single entry point (`handle_websocket_tick()`), creating tight coupling and maintenance complexity. While performance is adequate, the architecture lacks clarity and separation of concerns for different data types.

## Goals

1. **Document Current Architecture**: Create detailed documentation of the existing linear processing pipeline
2. **Identify Refactoring Opportunities**: Analyze code structure for areas requiring architectural changes
3. **Define Multi-Channel Requirements**: Establish technical specifications for channel-based processing
4. **Create Migration Strategy**: Develop a roadmap for transitioning from linear to multi-channel architecture
5. **Preserve System Integrity**: Ensure existing event detection logic and WebSocket publishing remain functional

## User Stories

**As a Developer:**
- I want comprehensive documentation of the current architecture so I can understand the system's processing flow
- I want to identify tightly coupled components so I can plan effective refactoring strategies
- I want clear requirements for the multi-channel system so I can implement it correctly

**As a System Architect:**
- I want to understand bottlenecks and complexity points so I can design an improved architecture
- I want to preserve working components while improving maintainability
- I want a clear migration path that minimizes risk during implementation

**As a Maintenance Engineer:**
- I want better separation of concerns so I can debug and maintain specific data processing paths
- I want clear component boundaries so I can modify one data type without affecting others

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Current Architecture Documentation ✅ LARGELY COMPLETE
**Foundation**: Existing documentation in `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` provides:
- Complete data flow from RealTimeAdapter through MarketDataService.handle_websocket_tick()
- All pipeline components mapped: EventProcessor, EventDetector, Individual Detectors
- Method call chain and file hierarchy documentation
- Key data flow points and processing responsibilities

**Additional Research Required**:
1.1. **EventProcessor → WebSocket Publisher Flow**: Document the complete flow from event detection to WebSocket client delivery
1.2. **Current Configuration Patterns**: Analyze how the existing system handles configuration management and settings
1.3. **Event Format Structures**: Document the event data structures and formats used by the WebSocket publisher

### 2. Gap Analysis
2.1. Identify single entry point bottleneck at `handle_websocket_tick()`
2.2. Document tight coupling between MarketDataService and EventProcessor
2.3. Analyze lack of data type differentiation in current processing
2.4. Document current strengths to preserve (typed events, priority queue, universe management)

### 3. Multi-Channel Requirements Definition
3.1. Define processing channel abstraction requirements
3.2. Specify data routing requirements by type (Tick, OHLCV, FMV)
3.3. Define priority management requirements for different data types
3.4. Establish performance requirements for parallel processing

### 4. Component Analysis
4.1. Analyze `market_data_service.py` for refactoring opportunities
4.2. Review `event_processor.py` for multi-source capabilities
4.3. Assess current event detection logic for channel compatibility
4.4. Evaluate existing priority queue mechanism for enhancement

### 5. Migration Planning
5.1. Create step-by-step migration strategy from linear to multi-channel
5.2. Identify components requiring replacement vs enhancement
5.3. Define testing strategy for architectural changes
5.4. Plan deployment approach for big-bang implementation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Frontend modifications or WebSocket client changes
- Performance optimization (current performance is adequate)
- Database schema changes
- Event detection algorithm modifications
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Production deployment planning

## Technical Considerations

### Current System Preservation
- Maintain existing typed event system (Phase 4)
- Preserve working priority queue mechanism
- Keep universe management structure intact
- Retain functional event detection logic

### Documentation Requirements
- Update `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` with current state analysis
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for major findings
- Document all identified coupling points and dependencies

### Analysis Tools
- Use static code analysis to identify coupling metrics
- Create dependency graphs for current components
- Document all data flow paths and decision points

## Success Metrics

1. **Documentation Completeness**: 100% of processing pipeline documented with visual diagrams
2. **Gap Identification**: All architectural gaps documented with priority ratings (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. **Requirements Clarity**: Multi-channel requirements defined with acceptance criteria
4. **Migration Readiness**: Complete migration strategy with step-by-step implementation plan
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Architecture review approved by development team

## Open Questions

1. Are there any undocumented processing paths or edge cases in the current system?
2. What specific metrics should we track during the architectural transition?
3. Are there any external dependencies that could impact the multi-channel implementation?
4. Should we implement any monitoring/observability improvements during this analysis phase?
5. Are there any compliance or regulatory considerations for the architectural changes?

## Deliverables

- **Updated Process Pipeline Documentation**: Enhanced `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` with:
  - EventProcessor → WebSocket Publisher flow documentation
  - Current configuration patterns analysis  
  - Event format structures used by WebSocket publisher
- **Gap Analysis Report**: Detailed matrix of current vs target state with priorities
- **Multi-Channel Requirements Specification**: Technical requirements for new architecture
- **Migration Strategy Document**: Step-by-Step implementation roadmap for Sprints 104-108

## Sprint Dependencies

**Input**: Existing `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` (foundation documentation)
**Output**: Enhanced `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` (referenced by all subsequent sprints)
**Referenced By**: Sprints 104-108 will use the enhanced pipeline documentation as the architectural foundation
