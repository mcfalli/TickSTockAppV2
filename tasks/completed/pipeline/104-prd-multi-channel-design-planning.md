# Sprint 104 PRD: Multi-Channel Design & Planning

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint focuses on designing the detailed architecture for the multi-channel processing system that will replace the current linear pipeline. Based on the analysis from Sprint 103, this sprint will create the technical blueprints, data structures, and system design for implementing parallel processing channels for Tick, OHLCV, and FMV data types.

**Problem Statement:** The current single-entry point architecture lacks separation of concerns and clarity for different data types. We need a well-designed multi-channel system that provides clear boundaries between data processing paths while maintaining system performance and reliability.

## Goals

1. **Design Channel Architecture**: Create detailed technical specifications for the multi-channel processing system
2. **Define Channel Configuration**: Establish configuration patterns for different data types and priorities
3. **Design Data Flow Architecture**: Plan the new routing and processing flow from data sources to event publication
4. **Create Component Interfaces**: Define clear APIs and contracts for channel components
5. **Plan Integration Points**: Design how channels will integrate with existing event detection and WebSocket systems

## User Stories

**As a Developer:**
- I want clear channel interfaces and abstractions so I can implement data type specific processing logic
- I want well-defined configuration patterns so I can easily adjust channel behavior for different data types
- I want comprehensive design documentation so I can implement the multi-channel system correctly

**As a System Architect:**
- I want a scalable channel design that can accommodate future data types without architectural changes
- I want clear separation between channel routing and event processing logic
- I want integration patterns that preserve existing event detection and WebSocket functionality

**As a Maintenance Engineer:**
- I want independent channel processing so I can troubleshoot specific data types without affecting others
- I want configurable channel behavior so I can adjust processing parameters without code changes

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Channel Architecture Design
1.1. Design abstract `ProcessingChannel` base class with standardized interface
1.2. Define channel lifecycle management (initialization, processing, shutdown)
1.3. Create channel metrics and monitoring interfaces
1.4. Design channel configuration management system

### 2. Data Type Channel Specifications
2.1. Design `TickChannel` for real-time tick data processing (Priority 1)
2.2. Design `OHLCVChannel` for minute aggregate data processing (Priority 2)
2.3. Design `FMVChannel` for fair market value data processing (Priority 3)
2.4. Define channel-specific processing rules and event detection logic

### 3. Channel Router Design
3.1. Design `DataChannelRouter` for routing incoming data to appropriate channels
3.2. Create data type identification logic for automatic routing
3.3. Design channel load balancing and failover mechanisms
3.4. Create router configuration management system

### 4. Priority and Batching System
4.1. Design priority-based processing queue system
4.2. Create batching strategies for different channel types
4.3. Design timeout mechanisms for batch processing
4.4. Create backpressure handling for high-volume scenarios

### 5. Integration Architecture
5.1. Design integration with existing `EventProcessor`
5.2. Plan integration with current `WebSocketPublisher`
5.3. Create adapter patterns for existing event detection logic
5.4. Design data conversion interfaces between channels and existing systems

### 6. Configuration Management
6.1. Design channel configuration data structures
6.2. Create configuration validation and error handling
6.3. Design runtime configuration updates capability
6.4. Plan environment-specific configuration management

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Implementation of channel classes (reserved for Sprint 105)
- Frontend or WebSocket client modifications
- Database schema changes
- Event detection algorithm modifications
- Performance testing and optimization
- Production deployment configurations

## Design Considerations

### Channel Configuration Structure
```python
@dataclass
class ChannelConfig:
    name: str
    data_type: str
    priority: int  # 1=highest
    batch_size: int
    timeout_ms: int
    event_rules: Dict
```

### Channel Priority Levels
- **Priority 1 (TICK)**: Immediate processing, batch_size=1, timeout=10ms
- **Priority 2 (OHLCV)**: Batch processing, batch_size=100, timeout=100ms  
- **Priority 3 (FMV)**: Batch processing, batch_size=50, timeout=500ms

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Data Sources → Channel Router → Processing Channels → Priority Queue Aggregator → Event Publisher
```

## Technical Considerations

### Channel Interface Standardization
- All channels must implement common processing interface
- Standardized error handling and logging patterns
- Common metrics collection interface
- Consistent configuration management

### Backward Compatibility
- Channel outputs must be compatible with existing event detection
- Event format consistency across all channels
- WebSocket publishing integration without changes

### Scalability Design
- Channel system must support addition of new data types
- Router must handle dynamic channel registration
- Configuration system must be extensible

## Success Metrics

1. **Design Completeness**: 100% of channel architecture documented with UML diagrams and interface specifications
2. **Configuration Coverage**: All three data types (Tick, OHLCV, FMV) have complete configuration specifications
3. **Integration Clarity**: Clear integration plans for all existing system components
4. **Developer Readiness**: Technical specifications detailed enough for junior developer implementation
5. **Architecture Review Approval**: Design approved by development team with no major revisions required

## Open Questions

1. Should channels support dynamic configuration updates during runtime?
2. How should we handle channel failures and error recovery?
3. What monitoring and observability features should be built into the channel design?
4. Should we implement channel-level circuit breakers for fault tolerance?
5. How should we handle data type evolution (new fields, schema changes)?

## Deliverables

- **Channel Architecture Specification**: Complete technical design with UML diagrams
- **Channel Configuration Schema**: Detailed configuration structure and validation rules
- **Data Flow Design Document**: Visual diagrams and specifications for new processing flow
- **Component Interface Documentation**: API specifications for all channel components
- **Integration Design Document**: Plans for connecting channels with existing systems
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Technical guidelines and patterns for Sprint 105 implementation
