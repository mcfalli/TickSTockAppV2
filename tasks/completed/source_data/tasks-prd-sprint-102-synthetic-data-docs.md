### Notes

- Sprint 102 completes the multi-frequency implementation with synthetic data support
- Must maintain mathematical consistency across frequencies (minute bars = aggregated ticks)
- Integration with Sprint 100's configuration system and Sprint 101's WebSocket implementation
- Comprehensive documentation delivery for the entire multi-frequency system
- **Reference Document**: See `101-polygon-reference.md` for Polygon event schemas that synthetic data must simulate (AM, FMV events)
- **reference documentation**: .\docs\architecture\synthetic-data-architecture.md and .\docs\architecture\websocket-architecture.md
