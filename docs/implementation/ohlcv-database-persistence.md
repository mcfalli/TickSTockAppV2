# OHLCV Database Persistence Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds critical OHLCV data persistence to TickStockAppV2's MarketDataService, ensuring that tick data is properly saved to the TimescaleDB `ohlcv_1min` table with high performance and reliability.

## Problem Solved
Previously, tick data was processed and sent to WebSocket clients and Redis pub-sub, but **NEVER persisted to the database**, causing complete data loss. This implementation fixes that critical issue.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. OHLCVPersistenceService (`src/infrastructure/database/ohlcv_persistence.py`)
- **Connection Pooling**: Uses psycopg2 ThreadedConnectionPool for efficient database connections
- **Batch Processing**: Queues records and flushes in batches for optimal TimescaleDB performance
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Uses separate thread to prevent blocking real-time WebSocket delivery
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and connection health monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks batch timing, queue size, and persistence rates

#### 2. OHLCVRecord Dataclass
- Converts TickData to appropriate database format
- Rounds timestamps to minute boundaries for 1-minute aggregation
- Handles OHLC data extraction from tick data

#### 3. MarketDataService Integration
- Adds OHLCV persistence service as core component
- Integrates persistence call in `_handle_tick_data()` method
- Maintains <50ms performance target with non-blocking operations
- Enhanced health monitoring and statistics

### Database Schema Integration

The implementation persists to the existing `ohlcv_1min` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ohlcv_1min (
    symbol VARCHAR(20) REFERENCES symbols(symbol),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    open NUMERIC(10, 4),
    high NUMERIC(10, 4), 
    low NUMERIC(10, 4),
    close NUMERIC(10, 4),
    volume BIGINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (symbol, timestamp)
);
```

### Performance Features

#### Batch Processing
- Configurable batch size (default: 50 dev, 100 prod)
- Time-based flush intervals (2s dev, 5s prod)
- UPSERT operations with conflict resolution for duplicate timestamps

#### Connection Management
- Connection pool with 1-5 connections
- Connection health testing and automatic recovery
- 10-second connection timeout for reliability

#### Non-blocking Architecture
- Separate persistence thread prevents blocking real-time processing
- Queue-based architecture with overflow protection (1000 record max)
- Statistics tracking for monitoring and debugging

### Configuration

#### Development Environment (`config/environments/dev.py`)
```python
DB_BATCH_SIZE = 50  # Smaller batches for development
DB_FLUSH_INTERVAL = 2.0  # Flush every 2 seconds in dev
```

#### Production Environment (`config/environments/prod.py`)
```python
DB_BATCH_SIZE = 100  # Larger batches for production efficiency
DB_FLUSH_INTERVAL = 5.0  # Flush every 5 seconds in production
```

### Health Monitoring

#### Enhanced Health Endpoint (`/api/health`)
The existing health endpoint now includes OHLCV persistence monitoring:
- **Database connection status**
- **Persistence service health**
- **Queue size and batch statistics**
- **Error counts and performance metrics**

#### Service Statistics
Available through `MarketDataService.get_stats()`:
- `persistence_records_queued`: Total records queued for persistence
- `persistence_records_persisted`: Total records successfully saved
- `persistence_queue_size`: Current queue size
- `persistence_avg_batch_time_ms`: Average batch processing time
- `persistence_connection_test_passed`: Database connectivity status

### Error Handling

#### Database Failures
- Connection errors trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Failed records are re-queued for processing (up to queue capacity)
- Comprehensive error logging with context

#### Queue Overflow Protection
- Maximum queue size prevents memory issues during database outages
- Non-blocking queue operations prevent real-time processing disruption
- Warning logs when records are dropped due to full queue

### Integration Points

#### MarketDataService._handle_tick_data()
```python
# Persist tick data to database (non-blocking)
if self.ohlcv_persistence:
    persistence_success = self.ohlcv_persistence.persist_tick_data(tick_data)
    if not persistence_success:
        logger.warning(f"MARKET-DATA-SERVICE: Failed to queue tick data for persistence: {tick_data.ticker}")
```

#### Application Startup
```python
# Start OHLCV persistence service
if not self.ohlcv_persistence.start():
    logger.error("MARKET-DATA-SERVICE: Failed to start OHLCV persistence service")
    return False
```

#### Application Shutdown
```python
# Stop OHLCV persistence service
if self.ohlcv_persistence:
    self.ohlcv_persistence.stop()
```

## Architecture Compliance

### TickStockAppV2 Role Boundaries
- **Read-only UI queries**: Maintained through existing database access patterns
- **Write operations**: Limited to tick data persistence only
- **Performance targets**: <50ms database operations maintained through non-blocking design

### Pull Model Preservation
- Database persistence operations do not interfere with Pull Model architecture
- WebSocket delivery remains unblocked by database operations
- Zero event loss guarantee maintained

### TimescaleDB Optimization
- Batch inserts optimize for TimescaleDB's time-series architecture
- UPSERT operations handle duplicate timestamp scenarios
- Compression and retention policies work with persisted data

## Testing Results

### Functionality Test
- ✅ OHLCVPersistenceService initializes correctly
- ✅ OHLCVRecord converts TickData properly
- ✅ MarketDataService integrates persistence service
- ✅ Statistics and health monitoring work correctly
- ✅ Configuration supports dev/prod environments

### Performance Validation
- ✅ Non-blocking operations maintain real-time performance
- ✅ Batch processing optimizes database throughput
- ✅ Connection pooling handles concurrent access
- ✅ Queue management prevents memory issues

## Migration Notes

### Database Requirements
- Existing `ohlcv_1min` table structure (no changes required)
- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
- Database user with INSERT/UPDATE permissions on `ohlcv_1min` table

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required - uses existing `DATABASE_URI` configuration.

### Backward Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible - no breaking changes
- Existing functionality unchanged
- Additional persistence is purely additive

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- `persistence_records_persisted` - Ensure data is being saved
- `persistence_queue_size` - Watch for queue buildup indicating database issues  
- `persistence_avg_batch_time_ms` - Monitor for performance degradation
- `persistence_connection_test_passed` - Database connectivity status

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Queue size > 800 (approaching overflow)
- **Warning**: Average batch time > 100ms (performance degradation)
- **Critical**: Connection test failures (database unavailable)
- **Warning**: No records persisted for > 60 seconds (data pipeline issue)

## Summary

This implementation solves the critical data loss issue in TickStockAppV2 by adding robust, high-performance OHLCV data persistence while maintaining all existing architecture patterns and performance requirements. The solution is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and configuration support.
