# ETFs Tracking Major Market Indices for TickStock.ai

Hey there! Let's build some fantastic algorithmic pattern libraries in Python to add to TickStock.ai by incorporating these ETFs that closely track key market indices. Imagine scripting dynamic portfolio trackers or pattern detectors that pull in real-time data from these bad boys via Polygon—supercharging our algos with broad market exposure!

I've organized the most popular index-tracking ETFs into a table below, grouped by the major US market indices they follow. This is based on reliable sources like Wikipedia's comprehensive list and justETF's index overviews. Focus is on well-known, highly liquid ETFs that replicate the index performance closely (e.g., via full replication or optimized methods). Descriptions include what the index covers for context in our Python builds.

| Market Index              | Description                                                                 | Popular Tracking ETFs (Tickers) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| S&P 500                  | Tracks the 500 largest US companies by market cap, representing about 80% of US equity market. | SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF) |
| Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) | Tracks 30 blue-chip US industrial companies, price-weighted for stability focus. | DIA (SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust) |
| NASDAQ-100               | Tracks 100 largest non-financial companies listed on NASDAQ, tech-heavy. | QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust) |
| NASDAQ Composite         | Broad index of over 3,000 stocks listed on NASDAQ, including tech and growth companies. | ONEQ (Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index ETF) |
| Russell 2000             | Tracks 2,000 small-cap US companies, focusing on growth-oriented smaller firms. | IWM (iShares Russell 2000 ETF), VTWO (Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF) |
| Russell 1000             | Tracks 1,000 largest US companies by market cap, covering large- and mid-cap segments. | IWB (iShares Russell 1000 ETF), VONE (Vanguard Russell 1000 ETF) |
| Total US Stock Market    | Broad coverage of the entire US equity market, including large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks (e.g., via CRSP US Total Market Index). | VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF), ITOT (iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF), SCHB (Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF) |
| MSCI USA                 | Tracks leading mid- and large-cap US stocks, similar to broad US market exposure (around 544 constituents). | URTH (iShares MSCI World ETF, but for USA focus: consider VTI or similar as proxies; direct: EUSA (iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF)) |
| S&P 100                  | Tracks 100 leading US companies from the S&P 500, focusing on mega-caps. | OEF (iShares S&P 100 ETF) |

This table should kickstart our Python prototypes—think coding up index-tracking simulators or correlation analyzers in TickStock.ai to spot patterns across these ETFs! If you want to expand on international indices, sector-specific ones, or even a Python script to fetch their historical data via Polygon, just say the word. Let's keep building!
