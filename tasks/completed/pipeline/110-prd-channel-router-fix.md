# Sprint 110 PRD: Channel Router Architecture Fix

**Created:** 2025-08-22  
**Sprint:** 110  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  

## Introduction/Overview

Sprint 110 addresses the critical Channel Router Architecture issue identified in Sprint 109 diagnosis. Despite having healthy channels that successfully process data via fallback mechanisms, the enhanced router consistently reports routing failures, preventing proper delegation flow. This PRD defines the scope for fixing the router logic to achieve successful channel delegation and complete end-to-end data processing.

**Problem Statement:** The DataChannelRouter reports `['Channel routing failed']` despite:
- TickChannel status = active, healthy = True
- Successful channel registration and initialization  
- Working channel processing via fallback mechanism
- Zero processing errors (error rate = 0.000)

## Goals

1. **Resolve Router Logic Inconsistency**: Fix the disconnect between channel health status and routing success determination
2. **Achieve Successful Channel Delegation**: Transition from 0 successful delegations to positive delegation counts
3. **Complete End-to-End Data Flow**: Establish working pipeline from synthetic data → channel processing → frontend emission
4. **Maintain System Stability**: Ensure all fixes preserve existing functionality and performance characteristics

## User Stories

1. **As a System Operator**, I want the router to successfully delegate data to healthy channels so that the multi-channel architecture functions as designed
2. **As a Developer**, I want clear routing success/failure logging so that I can monitor delegation performance and diagnose issues  
3. **As a Data Consumer**, I want reliable data flow through the enhanced routing system so that market events reach the frontend consistently
4. **As a System Monitor**, I want accurate router health metrics so that I can track system performance and identify bottlenecks

## Functional Requirements

### Router Logic Analysis & Fix
1. **Deep Router Investigation**: The system must analyze the complete `route_data()` method flow in `src/processing/channels/channel_router.py` to identify success/failure determination logic gaps
2. **Return Value Chain Analysis**: The system must trace success/failure reporting through router → event processor communication to identify disconnects
3. **Channel Health Integration**: The router must properly utilize channel health status (`is_healthy()` = True) in routing decisions
4. **Success Path Identification**: The system must compare working fallback routing vs. failing normal routing to identify architectural differences

### Router Implementation Fixes  
5. **Routing Success Logic**: The router must return successful `ProcessingResult` objects when channels process data successfully
6. **Delegation Reporting**: The router must accurately report delegation counts (target: Delegated > 0) in diagnostic logging
7. **Error Handling Consistency**: The router must distinguish between actual routing failures and false negative reporting
8. **Integration Point Verification**: The router must ensure proper communication protocols with EventProcessor integration

### Validation & Testing
9. **Automated Pipeline Testing**: The system must include automated tests validating complete data flow from synthetic → router → frontend
10. **Manual Verification Process**: The system must provide manual testing procedures using synthetic per-minute data for end-to-end validation
11. **Router Health Monitoring**: The system must implement real-time router performance metrics and health status reporting

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Frontend UI Changes**: No modifications to frontend components or user interface elements
2. **Database Schema Modifications**: No changes to database structure, models, or data persistence layers
3. **New Feature Development**: No implementation of new features beyond fixing existing router functionality  
4. **Long-term Architecture Refactoring**: No major architectural changes; focus on fixing existing enhanced router design
5. **Performance Optimization**: Performance improvements secondary to functional correctness (functionality first approach)

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Context
- **Enhanced Router Design**: Must work within the existing multi-channel architecture specifications from Sprint 104-105
- **Fallback Compatibility**: Must maintain working fallback mechanism while fixing primary routing path
- **Event Integration**: Must preserve integration with existing priority_manager and event processing pipeline
- **Configuration Dependencies**: Must maintain compatibility with existing TickChannelConfig and detection parameters

### Integration Requirements  
- **Router ↔ EventProcessor Communication**: Verify and fix communication protocols between router and event processor
- **Channel Registration**: Maintain existing channel registration process (`1 tick channels: ['primary_tick']`)
- **Health Status Integration**: Leverage existing channel health monitoring (`status=active, healthy=True`)
- **Transport Dictionary Conversion**: Maintain event type consistency through Worker boundary (typed → dict conversion)

### Investigation Approach
- **Parallel Investigation and Implementation**: Combine deep analysis with targeted fixes based on findings
- **Documentation-Driven**: Leverage existing process documentation and architectural specifications for guidance  
- **Evidence-Based Debugging**: Use existing diagnostic logs and channel status verification for root cause analysis

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Router Delegation Success**: Achieve positive delegation counts (Delegated > 0) in diagnostic logging
2. **End-to-End Data Flow**: Complete synthetic data processing from WebSocket → router → frontend emission
3. **Routing Success Rate**: Eliminate `['Channel routing failed']` messages for healthy channels
4. **Channel Health Correlation**: Router success reporting accurately reflects channel health status

### Performance Validation
1. **Functionality Over Performance**: Successful routing functionality achieved (performance optimization secondary)
2. **Error Rate Maintenance**: Maintain current 0.000 error rate in channel processing
3. **System Stability**: No degradation in existing system components during fix implementation

### Testing Validation  
1. **Automated Test Coverage**: Implemented automated pipeline flow validation tests
2. **Manual Testing Success**: Verified manual testing procedures with synthetic per-minute data
3. **Diagnostic Logging Clarity**: Enhanced logging provides clear insight into routing decisions and outcomes

## Open Questions

1. **Router Logic Specification**: Are there specific router logic patterns or validation steps documented that should guide the investigation?
2. **Event Processor Communication**: Are there known communication protocol requirements between router and event processor that may be misconfigured?
3. **Success Determination Criteria**: What specific conditions should the router evaluate to determine successful vs. failed routing?
4. **Fallback vs. Normal Routing**: Should the investigation prioritize understanding why fallback works to inform normal routing fixes?
5. **Integration Testing Scope**: Should the testing focus primarily on synthetic data validation or expand to additional data sources?
