# Sprint 105 PRD: Core Channel Infrastructure

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint implements the foundational infrastructure for the multi-channel processing system designed in Sprint 104. The focus is on creating the base channel classes, channel router, priority management system, and core infrastructure components that will serve as the backbone for all data type specific channels.

**Problem Statement:** With the multi-channel architecture designed, we need to implement the core infrastructure components that provide standardized channel processing, routing capabilities, and priority management to replace the current single-entry point system.

## Goals

1. **Implement Base Channel Class**: Create the abstract `ProcessingChannel` foundation for all data type channels
2. **Build Channel Router**: Implement `DataChannelRouter` for routing data to appropriate channels
3. **Create Priority Management**: Implement priority-based processing and batching system
4. **Establish Metrics System**: Build channel metrics collection and monitoring infrastructure
5. **Implement Configuration Management**: Create channel configuration loading and validation system

## User Stories

**As a Developer:**
- I want a working base channel class so I can implement data type specific channels in Sprint 106
- I want a functional channel router so I can route different data types to appropriate processors
- I want standardized metrics collection so I can monitor channel performance

**As a Channel Implementer:**
- I want clear base class methods to override so I can implement channel-specific processing logic
- I want access to configuration and metrics so my channels can be properly configured and monitored
- I want standardized error handling so I can focus on business logic implementation

**As a System Integrator:**
- I want working channel infrastructure so I can begin connecting it to existing event processing
- I want priority management so different data types are processed according to their importance
- I want metrics and monitoring so I can observe system behavior during integration

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Base Channel Infrastructure
1.1. Implement abstract `ProcessingChannel` base class with required interface methods
1.2. Create `ChannelMetrics` data class for tracking channel performance
1.3. Implement async processing queue management with configurable queue sizes
1.4. Create batch buffer management with timeout and size-based processing triggers

### 2. Channel Router Implementation
2.1. Implement `DataChannelRouter` class for routing incoming data
2.2. Create data type identification logic for automatic channel selection
2.3. Implement channel registry and initialization system
2.4. Create error handling for unknown data types and routing failures

### 3. Priority Management System
3.1. Implement priority-based processing queue system
3.2. Create batching logic based on channel configuration (batch_size, timeout_ms)
3.3. Implement immediate processing for high-priority channels (Priority 1)
3.4. Create batch processing coordination for lower-priority channels

### 4. Configuration System
4.1. Implement `ChannelConfig` data structure with validation
4.2. Create channel configuration loading from environment/files
4.3. Implement configuration validation and error reporting
4.4. Create default configuration values for each channel type

5.1. Implement metrics collection for messages processed, failed, and processing times
5.2. Create channel performance tracking and reporting
5.3. Implement logging integration with existing logging system
5.4. Create health check mechanisms for channel status monitoring

### 6. Error Handling and Recovery
6.1. Implement standardized exception handling across all channels
6.2. Create error recovery mechanisms for transient failures
6.3. Implement circuit breaker pattern for channel failure protection
6.4. Create error reporting and alerting integration

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Data type specific channel implementations (reserved for Sprint 106)
- Integration with existing EventProcessor (reserved for Sprint 107)
- Event detection logic modifications
- Frontend or WebSocket changes
- Production deployment configurations
- Performance optimization and tuning

## Design Specifications

### Base Channel Class Structure
```python
class ProcessingChannel(ABC):
    - config: ChannelConfig
    - metrics: ChannelMetrics
    - processing_queue: asyncio.Queue
    - batch_buffer: List
    - last_batch_time: float
```

### Channel Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class ChannelConfig:
    name: str
    data_type: str
    priority: int
    batch_size: int
    timeout_ms: int
    event_rules: Dict
```

### Channel Router Structure
```python
class DataChannelRouter:
    - config: Dict
    - channels: Dict[str, ProcessingChannel]
    - channel_registry: Dict
```

## Technical Considerations

### Async Processing Requirements
- All channel processing must be async-compatible
- Queue management must handle high-throughput scenarios
- Batch processing must respect timeout constraints

### Memory Management
- Implement queue size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Create buffer overflow protection (1000 events/type max)
- Implement proper cleanup for batch buffers

### Thread Safety
- Ensure thread-safe metrics collection
- Protect shared resources with appropriate locking
- Handle concurrent access to channel queues

### Integration Compatibility
- Channel outputs must be compatible with existing event system
- Maintain existing event data structures and formats
- Preserve current WebSocket publishing interfaces

## Success Metrics

1. **Infrastructure Completeness**: 100% of core channel infrastructure implemented and tested
2. **Router Functionality**: Data routing works correctly for all three data types (Tick, OHLCV, FMV)
3. **Priority Processing**: High-priority channels process immediately, low-priority channels batch correctly
4. **Metrics Collection**: All channel metrics are collected and reportable
5. **Configuration Management**: All channels can be configured through configuration files
6. **Error Handling**: System gracefully handles errors without crashing or losing data

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test base channel class abstract methods and concrete implementations
- Test channel router data type identification and routing logic
- Test priority management and batching behavior
- Test configuration loading and validation
- Test metrics collection accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Test multiple channels running concurrently
- Test router handling mixed data types simultaneously
- Test error recovery and circuit breaker functionality
- Test metrics aggregation across multiple channels

### Performance Tests
- Test queue performance under high load
- Test batching efficiency and timeout behavior
- Test memory usage with full buffer scenarios

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement channel warm-up procedures for better initial performance?
2. How should we handle partial batch processing failures?
3. Should channels support graceful shutdown with buffer draining?
4. What level of configuration hot-reloading should be supported?
5. Should we implement channel health checks and automatic restart capabilities?
