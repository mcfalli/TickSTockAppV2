# Polygon Attachments Summary for TickStock.ai Project Documentation

Hey there, fellow builder! As we gear up to craft some killer algorithmic pattern libraries in Python for TickStock.ai, let's dive into these Polygon attachments. I'll summarize each one in a crisp, markdown format to slot right into our project docs. Think of this as fuel for our market data pipelines‚Äîaccurate pricing models and product comparisons could inspire some sweet Python scripts for fair value calculations or data aggregation patterns. Let's break it down!

## 1. Polygon Business.pdf
This document appears to be empty or without provided content in the attachment. No pages or text were included, so it might be a placeholder or an error in the upload. If this is meant to contain business overview info (e.g., Polygon's services, pricing, or partnerships), we'd need the full file to summarize properly. For now, mark it as "Content Unavailable" in our docs‚Äîperhaps a quick Python scraper or API call could fetch similar info later for our algo library!

## 2. FMV Whitepaper.pdf (4 Pages)
This whitepaper introduces Polygon's **Fair Market Value (FMV)** product‚Äîa proprietary algorithm for estimating accurate security prices without the hassles of exchange fees or approvals. It's designed as an entry-level alternative to traditional trade data, especially for startups building apps like ours at TickStock.ai. Key highlights:

### Core Concept
- Traditional stock prices are approximations from recent trades, often with tradeoffs in cost, accuracy, and real-time access.
- FMV uses mathematical modeling of market factors with real-time inputs to generate a "fair" value, tested against historical tick data.
- Aims to be accurate for display (even thinly traded stocks) while avoiding barriers like exchange audits or fees.

### Accuracy Comparisons
- Tested against products like Delayed Consolidated Trades, IEX Last Trade, Nasdaq Last Sale, and Consolidated Trades.
- Metrics: Median, 90th, and 99th percentile errors vs. actual trade prices.
- Examples across tickers with varying volumes:
  - **AMD (High Volume, 80M avg daily)**:
    - FMV: 1.3¬¢ median error, 3.8¬¢ at 90th, 7.5¬¢ at 99th.
    - Beats IEX (4.0¬¢ median) and Delayed (29¬¢ median); close to Nasdaq (1.5¬¢) but better than single-exchange staleness.
  - **QQQ (Medium Volume, 60M avg daily)**: Similar patterns, FMV ranks high in accuracy.
  - **VXX (Low Volume, 5M avg daily)**: FMV handles thin trading well, outperforming stale single-exchange data.
- Visuals: Graphs show FMV tracking closely with consolidated trades, avoiding flat periods in single-exchange data.

### Methodology
- Analyzed millions of historical trades.
- For a trade \( T \), compare previous trade \( T' \) and current FMV \( L \) as predictors: Measure \( |T - T'| \) vs. \( |T - L| \).
- Result: FMV is a stronger predictor of next trade price than most alternatives (except full consolidated trades).

This is gold for our Python libs‚Äîimagine implementing a similar FMV algo pattern using libraries like NumPy or SciPy for market factor modeling. We could simulate historical tests in code to validate our own TickStock.ai patterns!

## 3. Polygon Equities.xlsx (Sheet: "Equities")
This Excel sheet compares Polygon's **US Stocks** products and expansion data feeds. It's structured as a table outlining features, coverage, data types, pricing, and restrictions. Perfect for evaluating market data options in our algo patterns‚Äîe.g., deciding on real-time vs. delayed feeds for Python-based trading simulations.

### Key Sections and Table Summary
- **Products Compared**: Base "Stocks Business" plus add-ons like Full Market Delayed, IEX, EDGX, Nasdaq Last Sale, Nasdaq Basic, and Full Market.
- **Features Overview** (excerpted in a simplified table for docs):

- **Pricing**: Base at $2000/mo; add-ons range from +$500/mo (Delayed/IEX) to +$2000/mo (others).
- **Restrictions & Fees**:
  - No exchange approvals for base; varies for add-ons (e.g., Nasdaq requires approvals).
  - Fees: Annual ($250+), Access ($300‚Äì$3000), Distribution ($250‚Äì$2000), User Fees ($0.1‚Äì$2 per user, scaling), Enterprise ($15K‚Äì$648K for unlimited).
  - Notes: All fees monthly unless specified; some are reportable feeds. Sources linked for each.

This sheet screams for a Python pandas script to parse and compare feeds dynamically in our TickStock.ai library‚Äîmaybe build a decision tree pattern for selecting optimal data sources based on cost vs. accuracy!

There you have it‚Äîconcise summaries ready to plug into our project files. If we need deeper dives (e.g., extracting full XLSX data via code or browsing related Polygon pages), let's iterate on some Python patterns to automate it. What's next for TickStock.ai? More algos incoming! üöÄ
