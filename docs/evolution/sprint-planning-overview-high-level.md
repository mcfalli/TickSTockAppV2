High-Level Sprint Plan

Phase 1: Design (Sprints 1-3)
- Sprint 1: Architecture & Requirements Definition
- Sprint 2: Pattern Classes & Specifications Design
- Sprint 3: Database Schema & Data Flow Architecture
Milestone: Review all design docs (e.g., evolution_index.md) for alignment.

Phase 2: Cleanup & Prep (Sprint 4)
- Sprint 4: TickStockApp Cleanup & Refactoring
Milestone: Validate cleaned TickStockApp shell with basic WebSockets forwarding.

Phase 3: Implementation (Sprints 5-7)
- Sprint 5: Core Pattern Library & Event Publisher
- Sprint 6: Pattern Scanner & Event Subscriber
- Sprint 7: Advanced Pattern Implementation
Milestone: Demo basic pattern detection and event publishing with sample data.

Phase 4: Testing (Sprints 8-9)
- Sprint 8: Unit & Integration Testing
- Sprint 9: End-to-End & Performance Testing
Milestone: Achieve 80%+ test coverage and meet benchmarks (e.g., <50ms event latency).

Phase 5: Data Integration (Sprints 10-11)
- Sprint 10: Database & Historical Data Integration
- Sprint 11: Real-Time Data & Event Blending
Milestone: End-to-end demo with historical seeding and real-time signals.
