# Draft 
PRD Sprint 109 and 110

# Intro
Sprint 109 Goal: Diagnose the data flow pipeline from synthetic websocket sources through to frontend emission, identifying where the processing chain breaks after Sprint 108 implementation.
Key Objectives:

Trace the data flow from synthetic per-minute updates through the complete pipeline
Identify runtime errors and processing breakdowns
Map the architecture from websocket ingestion → event detection → queue → emission → frontend
Document required fixes for Sprint 110 implementation

Technical Focus Areas:

WebSocket data ingestion (multiple sources, varying frequencies)
Event detection logic integration
Queue management and processing
WebSocketManager emission to frontend via emit_to_user()
JSON format compliance per docs\JSON.md

Sprint 109 Task List
Primary Tasks

A. Architecture trace & diagnosis
B. Identify breaking points in data flow

Tracking for Future Sprints

Sprint 110: Implementation of identified fixes
Ongoing: Performance optimization considerations
Ongoing: Error handling enhancements
