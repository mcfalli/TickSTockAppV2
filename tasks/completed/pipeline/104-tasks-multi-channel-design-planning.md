# Sprint 104 Tasks: Multi-Channel Design & Planning

## Relevant Files

- `src/processing/channels/base_channel.py` - New abstract base class for processing channels (to be designed)
- `src/processing/channels/channel_router.py` - New data channel router component (to be designed)  
- `src/processing/channels/channel_config.py` - New channel configuration data structures (to be designed)
- `src/processing/channels/__init__.py` - New channel package initialization (to be designed)
- `docs/design/multi_channel_architecture.md` - New design documentation (to be created)
- `docs/design/channel_specifications.md` - New channel specifications document (to be created)
- `docs/design/integration_patterns.md` - New integration design document (to be created)
- `src/processing/pipeline/event_processor.py` - Existing component requiring integration design analysis
- `src/presentation/websocket/publisher.py` - Existing component requiring integration design analysis

### Notes

- This sprint focuses on design and specification creation, not implementation
- Design documents will serve as blueprints for Sprint 105 implementation
- No unit tests required as this is a design-focused sprint
- Designs must preserve compatibility with existing event detection and WebSocket systems
