## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Compliance
- **Consumer Role**: Never implement pattern detection or processing logic
- **Redis Integration**: All TickStockPL communication via pub-sub only
- **Database Access**: Read-only queries for symbols, users, configuration
- **Performance**: Maintain <100ms WebSocket delivery, <50ms API responses

### Development Standards
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for each phase deliverable
- **Documentation**: Update architecture docs with each new component
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data protection
- **Scalability**: Design all components for horizontal scaling

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Dashboard usage and interaction rates
- **Performance**: Response times and system reliability
- **Integration**: Successful TickStockPL event consumption
- **Market Insights**: Accuracy of market state detection and alerts

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **TickStockPL Integration**: Validate all Redis channels before UI development
- **Performance**: Load test each dashboard component individually
- **Data Volume**: Plan for high-frequency pattern event processing

### User Experience Risks  
- **Complexity**: Maintain simple, intuitive interfaces despite advanced features
- **Information Overload**: Provide clear filtering and prioritization options
- **Learning Curve**: Include help systems and guided tours

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Backend**: 1 developer for API and service layer
- **Frontend**: 1 developer for dashboard and UI components
- **Integration**: Shared responsibility for TickStockPL integration testing

### Infrastructure
- **Redis**: Optimized for high-frequency pattern event processing
- **Database**: Read-only optimizations for user and symbol queries
- **WebSocket**: Load balancing for real-time dashboard updates

## Conclusion

This phased approach prioritizes user-requested features while maintaining architectural compliance with TickStockPL integration. Each phase builds upon previous work and maintains focus on consumer-side enhancements rather than duplicating producer functionality.
