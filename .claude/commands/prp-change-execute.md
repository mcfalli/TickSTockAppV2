## Mission: Safe Modification Without Breaking Changes

CHANGE PRPs enable safe code modifications through:

- **Current Implementation Understanding**: Know what exists before changing it
- **Dependency Awareness**: Understand what depends on the code being modified
- **Impact Mitigation**: Anticipate and prevent breakage
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure existing functionality preserved
- **Progressive Validation**: 5-level gates catch regressions early
- Read PRPs/README.md to understand PRP concepts

**Your Goal**: Transform the PRP into working changes that pass all validation gates WITHOUT breaking existing functionality.

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified CHANGE PRP file completely
   - Absorb current implementation analysis, dependency maps, impact assessment
   - Review BEFORE/AFTER code examples thoroughly
   - Trust the PRP's analysis - it's designed to prevent breaking changes
   - If needed do additional verification of current implementation

2. **ULTRATHINK & Plan**
   - Create comprehensive modification plan following the PRP's change tasks
   - **CRITICAL**: Review "PRESERVE" notes in each task - what must NOT change
   - Break down into clear todos using TodoWrite tool
   - Use subagents for parallel work when beneficial (always create prp-inspired prompts)
   - Follow BEFORE/AFTER patterns from PRP exactly
   - Verify understanding of current implementation before modifying
   - Never guess - always verify current code matches PRP's analysis

3. **Pre-Modification Baseline**
   - **MANDATORY**: Document current state BEFORE making changes
   - Run all tests and verify they pass: `python run_tests.py`
   - Capture current performance metrics (if performance-related change)
   - Create git branch: `git checkout -b change/{feature-name}`
   - Take screenshots/output samples of current behavior if user-facing

4. **Execute Modification**
   - Follow the PRP's Change Tasks sequence precisely
   - For each task:
     - Read CURRENT implementation first
     - Verify it matches PRP's "CURRENT" description
     - Make changes following "CHANGE" instructions
     - Respect "PRESERVE" constraints (don't modify these parts)
     - Check "GOTCHA" warnings (edge cases to avoid)
   - Use BEFORE/AFTER code patterns from PRP
   - Update affected tests alongside code changes
   - Apply naming conventions from CLAUDE.md

5. **Progressive Validation (5 Levels for Changes)**

   **Execute the level validation system from the PRP:**
   - **Level 1**: Run syntax & style validation (ruff)
   - **Level 2**: Execute unit test validation (pytest unit tests)
   - **Level 3**: Run integration testing (python run_tests.py)
   - **Level 4**: Execute TickStock-specific validation (architecture, performance)
   - **Level 5**: **REGRESSION TESTING** (verify old functionality still works)

   **Each level must pass before proceeding to the next.**

   **Level 5 is CRITICAL for changes** - ensures no breaking changes introduced.

6. **Regression Verification (MANDATORY for Changes)**
   - **Test unchanged functionality**: Verify features NOT modified still work
   - **Test dependent features**: Verify components that depend on modified code still work
   - **Test edge cases**: Verify edge cases handled correctly (not broken by change)
   - **Performance comparison**: Compare before/after metrics (no degradation)
   - **Backward compatibility**: Verify old API contracts still work (if applicable)

7. **Completion Verification**
   - Work through the Final Validation Checklist in the PRP
   - Verify all Success Criteria from "What Changes" section are met
   - Verify all "PRESERVE" constraints were respected
   - Confirm all Anti-Patterns were avoided
   - Verify no breaking changes introduced (or migration path provided if intentional)
   - Changes are ready and working correctly

**Failure Protocol**:
- When validation fails, use the impact analysis and gotchas from PRP to fix issues
- Re-run validation until passing
- If breakage occurs, check if it was identified in impact analysis (expected vs unexpected)
- Document unexpected breakage in AMENDMENT file

## Post-Execution Documentation

After successful implementation, create sprint documentation:

### 1. Implementation Results (Required)
**File**: `docs/planning/sprints/sprint{N}/{change-name}-RESULTS.md`

**Contents**:
- ‚úÖ Success criteria met (reference PRP "What Changes" section)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Implementation time (actual vs estimated)
- üéØ Performance metrics achieved (before vs after comparison)
- ‚úÖ Validation results (all 5 levels including regression testing)
- üìù Manual testing results
- üîÑ Regression test results (confirm no breaking changes)
- üìä Before/After metrics comparison
- üîó Related commits/PRs

### 2. Lessons Learned (If Applicable)
**File**: `docs/planning/sprints/sprint{N}/{change-name}-AMENDMENT.md`

**Create if**:
- PRP had gaps in current implementation analysis
- Unexpected dependencies discovered during modification
- Required debugging iterations beyond initial implementation
- Unforeseen breakage occurred (document cause and fix)
- Impact analysis missed something important

**Contents**:
- What was missing from PRP (current implementation gaps)
- Unexpected dependencies found during implementation
- How many debugging iterations required
- Breakage that occurred and how it was fixed
- Correct modification patterns discovered
- Recommendations for PRP change template improvements

### 3. Migration Guide (If Breaking Changes)
**File**: `docs/planning/sprints/sprint{N}/{change-name}-MIGRATION.md`

**Create if**:
- Change introduced breaking changes
- Deprecated old API/function
- Changed database schema
- Modified Redis message format
- Updated WebSocket event structure

**Contents**:
- What changed and why
- Who is affected (developers, frontend, TickStockPL, etc.)
- Migration steps (with code examples)
- Timeline (deprecation ‚Üí removal schedule)
- Backward compatibility period (if any)

### 4. Update Sprint Tracking
- Update sprint README or tracking document
- Mark change as complete
- Link to PRP and results documents
- Note any deferred work for backlog
- Document any breaking changes and migration timeline

## Change-Specific Execution Checklist

During execution, continuously verify:

- [ ] I am reading CURRENT implementation before modifying
- [ ] I am following BEFORE ‚Üí AFTER patterns from PRP
- [ ] I am respecting PRESERVE constraints in each task
- [ ] I am updating affected tests alongside code changes
- [ ] I am running validation after each significant modification
- [ ] I am checking for unintended side effects
- [ ] I am documenting any unexpected breakage
- [ ] I am comparing performance metrics before/after
- [ ] I am testing regression scenarios (old functionality)
- [ ] I am verifying backward compatibility (if required)

## Regression Testing Requirements (Level 5)

**CRITICAL for all changes** - ensure existing functionality preserved:

```bash
# 1. Run full integration test suite (must all pass)
python run_tests.py

# 2. Test specific regression scenarios from PRP
python tests/integration/test_{feature}_regression.py -v

# 3. Manual regression verification
# - Test features that depend on modified code
# - Test edge cases that might be affected
# - Verify error handling still works correctly

# 4. Performance comparison (if applicable)
# Compare before/after metrics:
# - Database query times (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
# - Redis operation latency
# - WebSocket delivery times
# - API response times

# 5. Backward compatibility verification (if applicable)
# Test old API contracts:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/old_endpoint
# Expected: Still works (or graceful deprecation warning)

# Test new functionality:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/new_endpoint
# Expected: New behavior works correctly
```

## Common Change Pitfalls to Avoid

**During Execution:**

- ‚ùå **Don't modify before understanding current implementation**
  - Always read current code first
  - Verify it matches PRP's analysis
  - If mismatch, update understanding before changing

- ‚ùå **Don't ignore PRESERVE constraints**
  - Each task lists what must stay the same
  - Changing these will break dependencies
  - Violation leads to cascading failures

- ‚ùå **Don't skip regression testing**
  - Old functionality must still work
  - Test dependent features
  - Verify edge cases not broken

- ‚ùå **Don't assume "nobody uses this"**
  - PRP lists all dependencies for a reason
  - Unexpected callers exist
  - Breaking them causes production issues

- ‚ùå **Don't change tests to make them pass**
  - If test fails, either:
    - Fix implementation (test is correct, code is wrong)
    - OR update test (behavior intentionally changed, documented in PRP)
  - Never hide failing tests by deleting or commenting them out

**Success Indicators:**

‚úÖ All 5 validation levels pass (including regression testing)
‚úÖ Current behavior preserved (where intended)
‚úÖ New behavior working correctly
‚úÖ Performance not degraded (metrics comparison)
‚úÖ No unexpected breakage (all breakage anticipated in PRP)
‚úÖ Tests updated and passing (old + new)
‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained (or migration guide provided)
