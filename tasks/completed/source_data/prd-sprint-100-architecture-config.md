# Sprint 100: Architecture Documentation & Configuration Enhancement

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint focuses on establishing the foundation for multi-frequency data source support in TickStock by thoroughly documenting the current architecture and implementing a flexible configuration system. The goal is to prepare the codebase for supporting multiple concurrent data frequencies (per-second, per-minute, fair market value) while maintaining backward compatibility with existing per-second processing.

**Problem it solves:** The current architecture is tightly coupled to per-second updates, limiting cost optimization through lower-frequency subscriptions and support for different data types.

## Goals

1. **Document Current Architecture**: Create comprehensive documentation of existing WebSocket and Synthetic data implementations
2. **Design Flexible Configuration**: Implement a configuration system that supports multiple data frequencies without breaking existing functionality
3. **Establish Foundation**: Prepare the codebase architecture for Sprint 101's multi-frequency WebSocket implementation
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure zero impact on existing per-second processing performance

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive documentation of the current WebSocket architecture so that I can understand how to extend it for multiple frequencies
2. **As a system administrator**, I want a flexible configuration system so that I can control data source behavior without code changes
3. **As a developer**, I want clear configuration schemas so that I can easily set up different data frequency combinations for testing and production
4. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want environment-based configuration so that I can deploy different settings across environments

## Functional Requirements

1. **Current Architecture Documentation**
   1.1. Document PolygonWebSocketClient class structure and event flow
   1.2. Document RealTimeDataAdapter integration patterns
   1.3. Document WebSocket subscription lifecycle management
   1.4. Document connection health monitoring and reconnection logic
   1.5. Document SimulatedDataProvider class implementation
   1.6. Document data generation algorithms and patterns
   1.7. Document current environment variables: USE_POLYGON_API, USE_SYNTHETIC_DATA
   1.8. Document CacheControl singleton behavior

2. **Configuration System Enhancement**
   2.1. Implement DATA_SOURCE_MODE environment variable with values: "production", "test", "hybrid"
   2.2. Implement ACTIVE_DATA_PROVIDERS environment variable supporting: ["polygon", "synthetic", "both"]
   2.3. Design JSON-based WEBSOCKET_SUBSCRIPTIONS configuration structure
   2.4. Design PROCESSING_CONFIG structure for batch processing controls
   2.5. Create configuration validation system to prevent invalid combinations
   2.6. Implement configuration loading with fallback to current defaults

3. **Configuration Schema Design**
   3.1. Define schema for per_second subscription configuration
   3.2. Define schema for per_minute subscription configuration  
   3.3. Define schema for fair_market_value subscription configuration
   3.4. Define processing behavior controls (batch_processing, batch_size, parallel_streams)
   3.5. Create comprehensive JSON schema documentation

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   4.1. Ensure existing USE_POLYGON_API behavior is preserved
   4.2. Ensure existing USE_SYNTHETIC_DATA behavior is preserved
   4.3. Maintain current per-second processing as default when no new config provided
   4.4. Verify zero performance impact on existing processing pipeline

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Implementation of actual multi-frequency WebSocket subscriptions (Sprint 101)
- Changes to synthetic data generators (Sprint 102)
- Frontend changes or user interface modifications
- Performance optimization beyond maintaining current levels
- Integration with RESTful data sources
- Changes to event detection or processing logic

## Design Considerations

- Configuration should follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use environment variables for high-level toggles, JSON configs for detailed settings
- Maintain singleton patterns where currently used (CacheControl)
- Follow existing logging and error handling patterns
- Configuration validation should provide clear error messages

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate with existing DataProviderFactory
- Configuration loading should happen at application startup
- JSON configuration should support environment variable interpolation
- Consider using Pydantic for configuration validation (if not breaking existing patterns)
- Configuration should be thread-safe for multi-frequency processing
- Document configuration precedence order (env vars vs JSON vs defaults)

## Success Metrics

1. **Documentation Completeness**: 100% of current WebSocket and Synthetic data architecture documented
2. **Configuration Coverage**: All planned configuration options implemented and tested
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Zero test failures in existing test suite
4. **Performance Maintenance**: No degradation in per-second processing latency
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear migration path from current to new configuration system

## Open Questions

1. Should configuration be hot-reloadable or require application restart?
2. What level of configuration validation is needed (fail fast vs. fallback to defaults)?
3. Should configuration changes be logged for audit purposes?
4. How should configuration errors be handled in production vs. development environments?
5. Should there be a configuration validation CLI tool for deployment verification?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete architecture documentation covering all current WebSocket and Synthetic data components
- [ ] New configuration system implemented with full backward compatibility
- [ ] JSON schema documentation for all configuration options
- [ ] Configuration validation system with clear error messages
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
