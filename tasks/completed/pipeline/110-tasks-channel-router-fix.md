# Sprint 110 Tasks: Channel Router Architecture Fix

**Created:** 2025-08-22  
**Sprint:** 110  
**Based on PRD:** `110-prd-channel-router-fix.md`

## Relevant Files

- `src/processing/channels/channel_router.py` - Main router implementation requiring logic fix
- `src/processing/channels/tick_channel.py` - TickChannel that processes successfully via fallback
- `src/core/services/market_data_service.py` - Integration point with router delegation
- `src/processing/pipeline/event_processor.py` - Event processor communication interface
- `tests/pipeline/test_channel_router.py` - Existing router unit tests to extend
- `tests/pipeline/test_router_fix_validation.py` - Validation tests for router fixes
- `tests/data_processing/sprint_105/test_channel_router.py` - Additional router test coverage
- `tests/integration/processing/test_end_to_end_routing.py` - New end-to-end integration tests
- `tests/pipeline/test_synthetic_data_routing.py` - New synthetic data routing validation tests

### Notes

- Tests should use existing patterns from `tests/pipeline/` and `tests/data_processing/sprint_105/`
- Router logic investigation should focus on `route_data()` method in `channel_router.py:498-574`
- Success determination logic appears to be in `_route_with_timeout()` method around lines 632-660
- Use existing diagnostic logging patterns for enhanced troubleshooting
