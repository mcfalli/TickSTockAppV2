7. docs/planning/sprints/sprint44/health-check-enhancement.md
8. docs/planning/sprints/sprint44/health-check-enhancement-AMENDMENT.md
9. scripts/prp_validator.py
10. docs/PRPs/ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md

SCORE (0-100):
1. Concept & Philosophy: /20
   - Solves "80% stall problem"?
   - Three layers well-defined?

2. Template Quality: /25
   - Comprehensive + TickStock-specific?
   - NEW vs CHANGE clear?
   - 4-5 validation levels?

3. Support Resources: /20
   - Pattern library (Flask, Redis)?
   - Decision tree usable?
   - Validation script works?

4. Real-World Evidence: /20
   - Sprint 44 case study solid?
   - Time savings quantified (~60 min)?
   - AMENDMENT feedback loop working?

5. Usability & Workflow: /15
   - Slash commands integrated?
   - Workflow clear?
   - Decision support effective?

DELIVERABLE:
- Score breakdown with 2-3 sentence justification per criterion
- Total score /100 and letter grade
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 improvements
- 1-paragraph verdict: Production-ready? Would you use it?

Expected score: 84-94/100 (B+ to A-)

## ✅ What Good Looks Like

**Score 90-100 (Grade A)**: Production-ready, minimal gaps, strong evidence
**Score 80-89 (Grade B)**: Mostly ready, some gaps, adequate evidence
**Score 70-79 (Grade C)**: Needs improvement, significant gaps
**Score <70**: Not production-ready

## 🎯 Expected Baseline (Self-Assessment)

| Criterion | Expected | Actual | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Concept | 18-20/20 | ____ | Strong articulation |
| Templates | 20-23/25 | ____ | Comprehensive, minor YAML issues |
| Resources | 17-19/20 | ____ | Strong library, missing SQLAlchemy |
| Evidence | 16-18/20 | ____ | Sprint 44 solid, need more data |
| Usability | 13-14/15 | ____ | Clear workflow, slash commands |
| **TOTAL** | **84-94** | ____ | **B+ to A-** |

## 🔍 Key Questions for Evaluator

1. **Does this solve the "80% stall problem"?** (Context + Implementation + Validation)
2. **Would you use this framework?** (Overhead vs value)
3. **Is Sprint 44 evidence convincing?** (60 min saved, 3 debug iterations → 0-1)
4. **Are templates production-ready?** ("No Prior Knowledge" test, TickStock-specific)
5. **Does pattern library prevent gaps?** (Flask context, Redis pub-sub documented)

---

## 🎬 Usage

1. **Open new Claude Code session** (unbiased evaluation)
2. **Paste Quick Evaluation Prompt** (above)
3. **Review evaluation results**
4. **Compare to expected baseline** (84-94/100)
5. **Action on top 3 improvements**

---

**Expected Result**: Confirmation that framework is production-ready (≥80/100) with actionable improvement recommendations.
