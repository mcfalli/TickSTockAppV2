# TickStock Architecture Overview

**Status**: Redirected to Updated Documentation  
**Last Updated**: August 25, 2025

## Current Architecture Documentation

This document has been **replaced** with updated architecture documentation that reflects the simplified system after the major cleanup effort (Phases 6-11).

**ðŸ‘‰ Current Architecture Documentation**: [`docs/evolution/simplified-architecture-overview.md`](evolution/simplified-architecture-overview.md)

## Quick Summary

TickStock has been dramatically simplified from a complex 25,000+ line system to a streamlined ~11,000 line application focused on:

- **Real-time market data ingestion** (Polygon.io + Synthetic)
- **Redis pub-sub integration** for TickStockPL
- **WebSocket broadcasting** for real-time UI updates
- **Simple linear data flow** (3 components vs. 6+ layers)

## Key Changes

- âœ… **60%+ code reduction** (14,300+ lines removed)
- âœ… **Architecture simplification** (6+ layers â†’ 3 components)  
- âœ… **TickStockPL integration ready** via Redis pub-sub
- âœ… **Performance improvements** through reduced complexity
