See: docs/sprints/sprint-108-completion-summary.md (Performance Baselines)
See: docs/design/integration_patterns.md (Integration Guidelines)
```

### **For Development Teams:**
- **Always start with** `project_overview_detailed.md` for system understanding
- **Follow** `instructions/coding-practices.md` for all development work
- **Use** `instructions/unit_testing.md` for testing standards and organization
- **Reference** `instructions/code-documentation-standards.md` for documentation requirements
- **Check** `agents/` for available automated development tools and capabilities
- **Reference sprint summaries** for understanding evolution and context
- **Use design documents** for implementation patterns

### **For Sprint Planning:**
- **Always reference** `instructions/` guides for development standards
- **Reference this index** to avoid embedding full documentation in sprint instructions
- **Point to specific sections** rather than entire documents when possible
- **Use sprint summaries** to understand what's already been built
- **Reference performance baselines** from Sprint 108 for performance-related work

### **For Code Reviews:**
- **Primary reference**: `instructions/coding-practices.md` for quality standards
- **Documentation check**: `instructions/code-documentation-standards.md` 
- **Testing validation**: `instructions/unit_testing.md` for test requirements

This index enables lean sprint instructions while ensuring teams have complete access to all necessary architectural and implementation guidance.
