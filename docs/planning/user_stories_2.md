## User Stories Continued Enhancements

### User Story 0.1: Historical Data Loading for Subset of Stocks

**User Story 0.1:**  
As a data analyst or backtester, I want to load actual historical OHLCV data for a user-selected subset of stocks from reliable APIs into the production database, so that I can validate patterns and run accurate backtests on real market cycles without relying on synthetic or incomplete datasets.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Data sources: Integrate with multiple providers (Polygon.io primary, yfinance fallback) for robust fetching, handling API keys and rate limits gracefully.  
- Subset selection: Allow specifying a list of symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, up to 1000+ for scalability) via UI input or config file in TickStockApp, forwarding the job to TickStockPL via Redis (e.g., tickstock.jobs.backtest channel).  
- Timeframes and aggregation: Load raw data into ticks or ohlcv_1min tables, with automatic resampling/aggregation to ohlcv_daily (e.g., using FIRST open, MAX high, LAST close, SUM volume) for multi-timeframe support.  
- Date range: Configurable from/to dates (e.g., last 5 years default), with validation for data gaps and timezone consistency (UTC).  
- Database optimization: Use TimescaleDB hypertables with partitioning by symbol/time, compression for older data (>90 days), and batch inserts for efficiency (<10ms queries).  
- Error handling: Graceful retries for API failures, logging to events table, and notifications if data integrity issues arise (e.g., missing volumes).  
- Integration test: Load data for 5 symbols over 1 year, verify in DB, and confirm DataBlender can blend it with real-time feeds for pattern detection (e.g., Doji on historical AAPL).  
- Performance: <1s per symbol for daily data load, supporting institutional-grade backtesting foundation.


### User Stories for 1: Real-Time Pattern Alert Notifications

**User Story 1.1:**  
As a day trader, I want to receive instant web alerts, that I have interest in, for detected intra-day patterns like Hammer or MA Crossover or trendings via WebSockets, so that I can react quickly to trading opportunities without constantly monitoring charts.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Alerts update in <200ms from event publication in TickStockPL.  
- Include details: pattern name, symbol, price, timeframe (e.g., 1min), direction (bullish/bearish), and confidence score.  
- Configurable: Users can filter by pattern type or symbol watchlist.  
- Integration: Ties to EventPublisher in TickStockPL for Redis pub-sub.  
- Edge Case: Handle high-volume alerts (1000+ symbols) without UI lag.

**User Story 1.2:**  
As a swing-trader, I want to receive instant web alerts, that I have interest in, for detected multi-day and or intra-day patterns like Crossover via WebSockets, so that I can review for potential trading opportunities without constantly monitoring charts.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Alerts update in <200ms from event publication in TickStockPL.  
- Include details: pattern name, symbol, price, timeframe (e.g., 1min), direction (bullish/bearish), and confidence score.  
- Configurable: Users can filter by pattern type or symbol watchlist.  
- Integration: Ties to EventPublisher in TickStockPL for Redis pub-sub.  
- Edge Case: Handle high-volume alerts (1000+ symbols) without UI lag.

**User Story 1.3:**  
As a portfolio manager, I want customizable notification settings (e.g., email/SMS fallback for critical patterns), so that I get alerted even when not actively using the app.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Settings persist in the shared TimescaleDB (e.g., users table extension).  
- Supports thresholds like min confidence >80% or specific patterns (e.g., Day1Breakout).  
- Test: Simulate 11+ patterns from our library triggering alerts in real-time demo.

### User Stories for 2: Interactive Stock Charts with Pattern Overlays

**User Story 2.1:**  
As an analyst, I want interactive OHLCV charts with overlaid pattern markers (e.g., arrows for Bullish Engulfing), so that I can visually validate detections across timeframes like 1min or daily.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Charts use lightweight JS libraries (e.g., Chart.js) in TickStockApp OR TradingView.  
- Overlays: Color-coded annotations from PatternScanner events, with hover tooltips showing timestamp, volume, and signal strength.  
- Data Source: Blended from ohlcv_1min/daily tables via DataBlender in TickStockPL.  
- Interactive: Zoom/pan, timeframe switcher with resampling.  
- Performance: Load <1s for 1000+ bars, supporting institutional-grade scalability.

**User Story 2.2:**  
As a beginner trader, I want tooltips and explanations on pattern overlays (e.g., "Hammer: Bullish reversal after downtrend"), so that I can learn while analyzing charts.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Tooltips pull from pattern specs (e.g., from patterns_library_patterns.md).  
- Include links to docs in TickStock.ai static site.  
- Accessibility: ARIA labels for screen readers, mobile-responsive design.

### User Stories for 3: Live Dashboard with Symbol Watchlist and Metrics

**User Story 3.1:**  
As a professional trader, I want a live dashboard table showing my watchlist symbols with current prices, detected patterns, and metrics like signal strength, so that I can monitor multiple assets (up to 1000+) in real-time.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Table updates via WebSockets from tickstock.events.patterns channel.  
- Columns: Symbol, Price, Pattern, Timeframe, Strength, Update Time (as in the example table).  
- Sorting/Filtering: By pattern type or strength; persists user preferences in DB.  
- Scalability: Handles concurrent processing from Sprint 7's 1.12ms detection.

**User Story 3.2:**  
As a professional trader, I want a live dashboard table showing stocks correlated in simularity to my watchlist symbols with current prices, detected patterns, and metrics like signal strength, so that I can monitor multiple assets (up to 1000+) in real-time.  In other words, "show me stocks similar to my watchlist stocks that are demonstrating or triggering the same or similar patterns as my watchlist". 
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Table updates via WebSockets from tickstock.events.patterns channel.  
- Columns: Symbol, Price, Pattern, Timeframe, Strength, Update Time (as in the example table).  
- Sorting/Filtering: By pattern type or strength; persists user preferences in DB.  
- Scalability: Handles concurrent processing from Sprint 7's 1.12ms detection.

**User Story 3.3:**  
As an institutional user, I want to add/remove symbols to the watchlist and export dashboard data (e.g., CSV of patterns), so that I can integrate with external tools for deeper analysis.  
*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- Watchlist stored in TimescaleDB (e.g., user_watchlists table).  
- Export: Includes full event details from TickStockPL (pattern, timestamp, etc.).  
- Security: Role-based access, aligning with our non-functional requirements.
