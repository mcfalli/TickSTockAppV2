Sprint 100: Product Requirements Document
Multi-Frequency Data Source Support for WebSocket and Simulated Interfaces

Executive Summary
Sprint Goal
Enhance TickStock's data ingestion architecture to support multiple concurrent data frequencies (per-second, per-minute, fair market value) from Polygon WebSocket and Simulated/Synthetic data sources while maintaining backward compatibility with existing per-second processing.
Business Value

Flexibility: Support various data update frequencies to accommodate different use cases and reduce costs
Scalability: Enable parallel processing of multiple data streams without interference
Development Efficiency: Enhanced synthetic data simulation for all production frequencies
Future-Ready: Architectural foundation for RESTful data sources and additional providers

Success Criteria

 Multiple WebSocket subscriptions running concurrently without data loss
 Configuration-driven frequency selection for both production and test modes
 Synthetic data accurately simulating all supported frequencies
 Zero impact on existing per-second processing performance
 Complete documentation of configuration options and processing flows


Background & Context
Current State
TickStock currently operates with:

Per-second WebSocket updates from Polygon.io via PolygonWebSocketClient
Synthetic/Simulated data processor mimicking per-second updates for development
Event-driven architecture built around high-frequency tick processing
Real-time processing pipeline optimized for sub-millisecond latency

Problem Statement
The current architecture is tightly coupled to per-second updates, limiting:

Cost optimization through lower-frequency subscriptions
Support for different data types (fair market value, aggregated data)
Testing scenarios with varied update frequencies
Integration with providers offering different temporal resolutions

Proposed Solution
Implement a frequency-agnostic data ingestion layer that:

Maintains existing per-second processing as default
Adds configurable support for multiple concurrent frequencies
Enhances synthetic data to simulate all production frequencies
Prepares architecture for future RESTful integrations

### Fair Market Value
WS
Business: wss://business.polygon.io/stocks
Access to this API begins at the Stocks Business plan level.
Stream real-time Fair Market Value (FMV) data for a specified stock ticker via WebSocket. This proprietary metric, available exclusively to Business plan users, provides an algorithmically derived, real-time estimate of a securityâ€™s fair market price. By delivering accurate, continuous valuation data, this feed supports informed trading decisions, enhanced analytics, and more effective risk management.

Use Cases: Pricing strategies, algorithmic modeling, risk assessment, investor decision-making.

Parameters

### Polygon Background Documentation "Stocks Overview"
Stocks Overview
At Polygon.io, we provide real-time streaming access to U.S. stock market data through WebSockets, delivering a continuous flow of updates directly to your applications. Our WebSocket feeds include trades, quotes, aggregates (bars), limit-up/limit-down (LULD) events, and Fair Market Value (FMV) measurements, enabling developers, traders, and analysts to receive live, push-based market data with minimal latency. By tapping into these streaming endpoints, you can power dynamic dashboards, feed algorithmic trading strategies, and monitor market conditions as they unfold -- without the need for repeated requests.

Market Hours and Timezone
All stock market data delivered over WebSockets follows the standard U.S. equity trading sessions in Eastern Time (ET):

Pre-Market: 4:00 AM to 9:30 AM ET
Regular Market: 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM ET
After-Hours: 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM ET
While streaming endpoints remain active outside regular hours, the frequency and type of updates may vary depending on market activity and the data feed in question. All timestamps are provided as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch, UTC). When converting these timestamps into human-readable form (e.g., market open at 9:30 AM), remember they represent UTC time, not Eastern Time (ET). To correctly align data with market hours or dates, you'll need to explicitly convert timestamps from UTC to ET during your analysis.

Infrastructure and Reliability
Our WebSocket infrastructure is engineered for speed, stability, and scalability. By co-locating servers with exchanges and Securities Information Processors (SIPs), we minimize latency and ensure that you receive updates as quickly as possible. Redundant data centers and load balancing further enhance reliability, allowing us to maintain steady data delivery even under high load or challenging network conditions.

This real-time architecture ensures seamless, continuous data streams, ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as algorithmic trading, live charting, and event-driven analyses.

Data Flow: From Exchanges to You
Polygon.ioâ€™s WebSocket feeds draw data from the same robust sources as our REST endpoints. We combine direct connections to all major U.S. stock exchanges with SIP-consolidated feeds, ensuring that you receive the most accurate, timely, and comprehensive market data available.

As soon as trades, quotes, or other market events are published by the exchanges and consolidated by the SIPs, they are relayed through our infrastructure and pushed over our WebSocket channels to your subscribed clients. This near-instantaneous delivery supports real-time decision-making and dynamic updates to your trading or analytical systems.

Available WebSocket Feeds for Stocks
Our WebSocket channels deliver a broad range of streaming data, covering all critical aspects of market activity:

Aggregates (Per Minute): Receive OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) bars updated every minute. Ideal for intraday charting, real-time technical analysis, and monitoring market trends.
Aggregates (Per Second): Obtain second-by-second OHLC bars for ultra-fine-grained analysis. Useful for high-frequency strategies, liquidity assessments, and rapid response trading models.
Trades: Stream every executed trade in real-time, including price, size, exchange, and conditions. Perfect for tick-level analyses, order flow studies, and highly responsive trading algorithms.
Quotes: Access NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) quotes as they update. This feed supports monitoring the evolving price landscape, evaluating spreads, and identifying liquidity conditions.
Limit Up - Limit Down (LULD): Track real-time volatility safeguards and price bands triggered by regulatory mechanisms. Useful for detecting trading halts, resumption signals, and understanding rapid market movements.
Fair Market Value (FMV): Obtain our proprietary real-time FMV metric, exclusively available to Business plan users, offering an algorithmically derived estimate of a securityâ€™s fair market price.
By subscribing to these WebSocket feeds, you gain uninterrupted, event-driven data flow, eliminating the overhead of polling for updates and ensuring that your applications always stay in sync with the latest market conditions.

Next Steps
Leverage our documentation to integrate these WebSocket feeds into your applications. With a simple subscription model, you can dynamically select which tickers and data streams you need, enabling tasks such as:

Powering live dashboards and visualizations
Feeding algorithmic models with instantaneous updates
Conducting real-time risk management and compliance checks
Enhancing trading platforms with low-latency insights
By utilizing Polygon.ioâ€™s stock WebSocket feeds, you position your applications at the cutting edge of real-time market intelligence, empowering rapid, data-driven decision-making and innovation in the U.S. equity markets.
