## Proposed Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/planning/archive

# Move historical reports to archive
mv TickStockPL_Claude_feedback.md docs/planning/archive/TickStockPL_Claude_feedback_2025-09-27.md
mv credential_cleanup_report.txt docs/planning/archive/credential_cleanup_report_2025-09-26.txt
mv remaining_cleanup_report.txt docs/planning/archive/remaining_cleanup_report_2025-09-26.txt

# Verify files moved
ls -la docs/planning/archive/

# Verify root is clean
ls -la *.{txt,md,bat} | grep -v -E "(LICENSE|README|CLAUDE|start|test_streaming)"
# Should return empty (only keeping essential files)
```

---

## Additional Cleanup Opportunities

### Potential Areas to Review (Not in Root)

1. **Archive Directory**: `archive/sprint36_migration/`
   - Contains old Sprint 36 migration code
   - May be safe to compress or move to deep archive

2. **Test Files**: Review `tests/` for obsolete tests
   - Check for tests referencing removed features
   - Sprint-specific test directories that are complete

3. **Scripts**: Review `scripts/` for one-time migration scripts
   - Many admin setup scripts could be consolidated
   - Database integrity scripts may be redundant

4. **Documentation**: Review `docs/planning/sprints/` for consolidation
   - Older sprint documentation could be summarized
   - Consider creating sprint archive subdirectory

---

## Verification Checklist

After executing cleanup:

- [ ] All archived files accessible in `docs/planning/archive/`
- [ ] Root directory only contains essential files
- [ ] `start.bat` still works
- [ ] `test_streaming.bat` still works
- [ ] No broken references to moved files
- [ ] Git status shows expected file moves
- [ ] Archive directory has README explaining contents

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Execute Root Cleanup** (this document's recommendations)
2. **Review Archive Directory** (Sprint 36 migration files)
3. **Review Scripts Directory** (consolidate one-time scripts)
4. **Review Tests Directory** (remove obsolete test files)
5. **Create Archive README** (document what's in archive and why)

---

## Archive Directory README Template

Create `docs/planning/archive/README.md`:

```markdown
# Planning Archive

Historical documents and reports from completed tasks.

## Contents

### 2025-09-26 - Credential & Config Cleanup
- `credential_cleanup_report_2025-09-26.txt` - Security cleanup (25 files)

### 2025-09-27 - CLAUDE.md Improvements
- `TickStockPL_Claude_feedback_2025-09-27.md` - Suggestions (implemented)

## Purpose

This directory preserves historical documentation for:
- Audit trails of security/configuration changes
- Reference for future similar tasks
- Historical context of development decisions

Files here are no longer actively referenced but retained for compliance and historical purposes.
