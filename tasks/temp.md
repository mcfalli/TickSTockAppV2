User Connection Issue Summary - Real-Time Data Delivery Debug

  🎯 The Core Problem

  Users authenticate successfully and connect to WebSocket, but receive no real-time market data events despite the backend processing events correctly.

  📊 Progress Made Today

  ✅ Issues FIXED:

  1. Emission Timer Blocking: Fixed infinite timer hangs with async emission cycles
  2. User Authentication: Working correctly - users connect and stay connected
  3. Event Processing: Pipeline processes events normally (42 events → 30 queued)
  4. Timer Consistency: Emission timer now runs every 1.0 seconds reliably

  ❌ Current Issue: Buffer Lock Deadlock

  Root Cause Identified: get_buffered_events() in DataPublisher hangs during buffer pull

  🔍 Diagnostic Evidence

  From logs: Emission cycles progress through all steps until buffer pull:
  - ✅ Step 1-4: Complete successfully
  - ✅ Step 5: "Starting buffer pull"
  - ❌ Step 6: "Buffer pull completed" NEVER APPEARS
  - ❌ Step FINAL: "Emission cycle finished" NEVER APPEARS

  Hang Point: data_publisher.get_buffered_events() call in publisher.py:415-418

  🔧 Fixes Implemented

  1. Async Emission Timer (✅ Working)

  - File: src/presentation/websocket/publisher.py:267-282
  - Fix: Run emission cycles in separate threads to prevent timer blocking
  - Result: Timer runs consistently every 1.0 seconds

  2. Buffer Lock Timeout (🔍 Testing)

  - File: src/presentation/websocket/data_publisher.py:678-684
  - Fix: Replace blocking lock with 2-second timeout lock
  - Status: Implemented but still testing effectiveness

  3. Granular Debug Logging (✅ Added)

  - Emission Steps: Track exactly where cycles hang
  - Buffer Debugging: Show lock acquisition and buffer operations

  🎯 Next Steps for Tomorrow

  Priority 1: Complete Buffer Lock Fix

  The enhanced debugging will show exactly where the hang occurs:
  - If lock timeout works → cycles should complete
  - If lock acquisition hangs → need different locking strategy
  - If something else hangs → identify the specific operation

  Expected Debug Output:

  🔍 EMISSION-CYCLE-DEBUG: Step 5 - Starting buffer pull
  🔍 BUFFER-DEBUG: About to acquire buffer lock with 2s timeout
  🔍 BUFFER-DEBUG: Lock acquisition result: [True/False]

  Files to Monitor:

  - Main fix: src/presentation/websocket/data_publisher.py:678-684
  - Debug location: Look for "BUFFER-DEBUG" messages in logs
  - Success indicator: See "Step 6 - Buffer pull completed" messages

  💡 System Status

  - 99% Working: Authentication, event processing, emission timer all correct
  - 1% Missing: Buffer pull deadlock preventing data delivery to users
  - Impact: Users connect but receive no real-time events

  🔗 Key Architecture

  - DataPublisher: Collects events every 0.5s ✅
  - WebSocketPublisher: Pulls events every 1.0s ❌ (hangs on buffer pull)
  - User Flow: Connect → Register → Should receive data → Currently gets nothing

  The buffer lock timeout fix should resolve the final issue and enable complete real-time data delivery to connected users.
