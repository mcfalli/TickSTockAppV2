# CLAUDE.md - TickStock Development Assistant Guide

**Important** - CLAUDE documentation is stored local at ./.claude-code-docs to reference not having to go out to anthropic to find documentation. This is kept current daily.

## CRITICAL RULES (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

- **ALWAYS** run integration tests before commits and when finalizing a sprint or phase of a sprint: `python run_tests.py`
- **ALWAYS** use specialized agents for development tasks (see Agent Usage below)
- **ALWAYS** use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` or `find` for searching
- **ALWAYS** use Context7 MCP for current library documentation (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Redis, pandas, etc.) instead of relying on training cutoff
- **NEVER** mix typed events and dicts after Worker boundary
- **NEVER** reproduce copyrighted content (max 15 words from sources)
- **FIX IT RIGHT** - No band-aids, fix root causes only
- **NEVER** place Generated by Claude comments in code or commits 

## Quick Actions

**Need to implement a feature?**
1. Search project knowledge: What already exists?
2. Check agent triggers: Which agents are needed?
3. Validate approach: Run `architecture-validation-specialist`
4. Implement with tests: Use domain specialists
5. Verify: Run integration tests

**Common Commands**
```bash
# Run tests (MANDATORY before commits)
python run_tests.py
# Expected: 2 tests, ~30 second runtime, pattern flow tests passing

# Alternative test command
python tests/integration/run_integration_tests.py
# Expected: Same as above, more detailed output

# Check project structure
python scripts/dev_tools/generate_structure.py
# Expected: Tree structure of project files

# Database migrations
python model_migrations_run.py migrate "Description"
python model_migrations_run.py upgrade
# Expected: Migration applied, no errors

# Start all services
python start_all_services.py
# Expected: TickStockPL API on :8080, TickStockPL DataLoader, TickStockAppV2 on :5000

# Monitor WebSocket connections
ps aux | grep "flask run"
# Expected: Flask process running with active port
```

## Architecture Essentials

**TickStock.ai** is a high-performance platform for real-time and batch processing of market data, analyzing over 4,000 stock symbols with sub-millisecond efficiency. It leverages a three-tiered architectureâ€”Daily Batch Processing, Intraday Streaming, and Combo Hybrid Intelligenceâ€”to detect technical patterns (e.g., Doji, breakouts) and calculate indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) across intraday, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. Built with Python (pandas, NumPy, SciPy), it integrates Polygon API data and supports modular expansion via a dynamic loading system (NO FALLBACK policy).

**Components:**
- **TickStockAppV2**: Manages UI, authentication, and real-time WebSocket updates; consumes events and triggers jobs via Redis.
- **TickStockPL**: Handles pattern detection, data processing, backtesting, and TimescaleDB management; publishes events to Redis.

**Key Features:**
- Processes thousands of symbols/minute for intraday patterns/indicators
- Performs daily batch analysis for long-term trends, stored in TimescaleDB
- Correlates multi-timeframe signals with fundamentals (e.g., EPS surprises) for <5% false positives
- Achieves >300 symbols/second, >92% cache hit rates, with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Matplotlib integration

**Redis Pub-Sub**: Ensures loose coupling between components, with channels like tickstock.events.patterns and tickstock:monitoring for real-time events and metrics.



### Code Quality Standards

#### Structure Limits (ENFORCE)
- **Files**: Max 500 lines per file
- **Functions**: Max 50 lines per function
- **Classes**: Max 500 lines per class
- **Line Length**: Max 100 characters
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity <10

#### Naming Conventions
- **Variables/Functions**: snake_case (e.g., `process_pattern`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PatternProcessor`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Private**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_internal_method`)

#### Development Principles
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple - choose straightforward solutions
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - avoid speculative features
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - abstract common functionality
- **Fail Fast**: Check errors early, raise exceptions immediately
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose

- `docs/planning/sprints/BACKLOG.md` - Future work items

## ðŸ“Š Database & Configuration

### Database Access
```python
# Read-only user for application
User: app_readwrite
# NEVER query pattern tables directly - use Redis cache
# Pattern data comes via Redis pub-sub from TickStockPL
```

### Essential Database Queries
```sql
-- Check active user sessions
SELECT username, last_activity, session_id
FROM user_sessions
WHERE last_activity > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY last_activity DESC;

-- Monitor WebSocket connections by symbol
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as active_connections
FROM ws_subscriptions
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY active_connections DESC;

-- Check recent errors from TickStockPL
SELECT severity, message, error_context, created_at
FROM error_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
AND severity IN ('error', 'critical')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View processing run history
SELECT run_id, status, phase, started_at, completed_at,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - started_at)) as duration_seconds
FROM processing_runs
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY started_at DESC;

-- Check pattern detection stats
SELECT pattern_name, COUNT(*) as detections, AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM daily_patterns
WHERE detected_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY pattern_name
ORDER BY detections DESC;
```

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Logging
LOG_FILE_ENABLED=true
LOG_FILE_PATH=logs/tickstock.log
LOG_DB_ENABLED=true
LOG_DB_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD=error

# Redis Channels (with usage examples)
REDIS_ERROR_CHANNEL=tickstock:errors           # System errors
REDIS_PATTERN_CHANNEL=tickstock.events.patterns # Pattern detections

# Subscribe to events (Python example)
# await redis_client.subscribe('tickstock:monitoring')       # Metrics
# await redis_client.subscribe('tickstock:patterns:*')       # All pattern events
# await redis_client.subscribe('tickstock.events.indicators') # Indicators

# Tracing (for debug panel)
TRACE_ENABLED=true
TRACE_TICKERS=["NVDA", "TSLA", "AAPL"]
TRACE_LEVEL=VERBOSE

# TickStockPL Integration
TICKSTOCKPL_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions
| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Mixing event types after Worker | Always convert to dict at Worker boundary |
| Database queries in hot path | Use Redis or in-memory cache |
| Skipping tests | Integration tests are MANDATORY |
| Hardcoded credentials | Use environment variables only |
| Large functions | Max 50 lines per function |
| Copyright violations | Max 15 words from sources, with quotes |
| Mock endpoints in production | Remove ALL mock/test endpoints |

## Production Requirements

### Testing Status
```bash
# MANDATORY before any commit
python run_tests.py

# Current test status: 2 tests total
# - Core Integration: May fail if services not running
# - Pattern Flow: Should always pass
# Expected runtime: ~30 seconds
# Known issues: RLock warning (can ignore)
```

### MANDATORY Before Deployment
- âœ… All integration tests passing
- âœ… No mock endpoints or hardcoded data
- âœ… Redis pub-sub connected to TickStockPL
- âœ… Performance targets achieved (<1ms tick, <100ms WebSocket)
- âœ… Security scan completed (no hardcoded passwords)
- âœ… 90%+ test coverage on critical components

### Validation Gates (Track Progress)
- [ ] Integration tests passing (python run_tests.py)
- [ ] WebSocket latency <100ms verified
- [ ] Redis events consuming from TickStockPL
- [ ] No mock/stub endpoints in code
- [ ] Security scan clean (no hardcoded secrets)
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load
- [ ] Error handling tested end-to-end

## Communication Protocol
**When working on tasks:**
1. **Confirm understanding** - Restate the goal
2. **Analyze approach** - Summarize strategy with agent recommendations
3. **Ask clarifications** - Get answers BEFORE coding
4. **Implement** - Use agent workflow throughout
5. **Validate** - Run all required tests
6. **Document** - Update relevant documentation
7. **Document Completion** - Update completion summary
