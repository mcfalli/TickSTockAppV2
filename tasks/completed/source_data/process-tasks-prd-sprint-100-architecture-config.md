# Process Task List: Sprint 100 Architecture Documentation & Configuration Enhancement

## Implementation Protocol

This document tracks the implementation of Sprint 100 tasks following the task management protocol:

- **One sub-task at a time**: Do NOT start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol**: Mark sub-tasks as [x] when completed, run tests after parent task completion, commit with conventional format
- **Stop after each sub-task** and wait for user approval

## Current Status

**Next Task to Execute:** 1.1 - Document PolygonWebSocketClient class structure, singleton pattern, and connection lifecycle

## Task Progress Tracking

### 1.0 Document Current WebSocket Architecture
- [ ] 1.1 Document PolygonWebSocketClient class structure, singleton pattern, and connection lifecycle

- [ ] 1.3 Document connection health monitoring, heartbeat system, and reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] 1.4 Document event processing flow from raw Polygon events to typed TickData objects
- [ ] 1.5 Document RealTimeDataAdapter integration patterns and connection management
- [ ] 1.6 Create sequence diagrams for WebSocket connection establishment and data flow
- [ ] 1.7 Document current event types supported (T, A, Q) and their processing logic
- [ ] 1.8 Document error handling and status callback mechanisms

### 2.0 Document Current Synthetic Data Architecture
- [ ] 2.1 Document SimulatedDataProvider class implementation and DataProvider interface compliance
- [ ] 2.2 Document synthetic data generation algorithms (price seeding, time-based variance, market status)
- [ ] 2.3 Document tick data creation process and TickData object population
- [ ] 2.4 Document market session awareness and market status detection logic
- [ ] 2.5 Document SyntheticDataAdapter integration with RealTimeDataAdapter base class
- [ ] 2.6 Document tracing and monitoring capabilities in synthetic data generation
- [ ] 2.7 Document configuration-driven behavior controls (activity levels, rates, variance)
- [ ] 2.8 Document DataProviderFactory integration and provider selection priority

### 3.0 Design Multi-Frequency Configuration System
- [ ] 3.1 Design DATA_SOURCE_MODE environment variable schema and validation rules
- [ ] 3.2 Design ACTIVE_DATA_PROVIDERS environment variable with support for multiple providers
- [ ] 3.3 Design JSON-based WEBSOCKET_SUBSCRIPTIONS configuration structure for per-frequency settings
- [ ] 3.4 Design PROCESSING_CONFIG structure for batch processing, parallel streams, and stream isolation
- [ ] 3.5 Create configuration schemas for per_second, per_minute, and fair_market_value subscriptions
- [ ] 3.6 Design configuration validation system with clear error messages and fallback logic
- [ ] 3.7 Design configuration precedence order (environment variables > JSON config > defaults)
- [ ] 3.8 Create configuration migration guide from current single-frequency to multi-frequency setup

### 4.0 Implement Enhanced Configuration Loading
- [ ] 4.1 Extend ConfigManager.DEFAULTS with new multi-frequency configuration options
- [ ] 4.2 Add new configuration types to ConfigManager.CONFIG_TYPES with proper validation
- [ ] 4.3 Implement JSON configuration loading with environment variable interpolation
- [ ] 4.4 Implement configuration validation for multi-frequency settings and provider combinations
- [ ] 4.5 Update DataProviderFactory to support new configuration options while maintaining compatibility
- [ ] 4.6 Implement configuration loading at application startup with proper error handling
- [ ] 4.7 Add configuration logging for audit and debugging purposes
- [ ] 4.8 Create configuration validation utility functions for deployment verification

### 5.0 Validate Backward Compatibility and Performance
- [ ] 5.1 Run existing test suite to ensure zero test failures with new configuration system
- [ ] 5.2 Verify existing USE_POLYGON_API and USE_SYNTHETIC_DATA behavior is preserved
- [ ] 5.3 Performance test current per-second processing pipeline to establish baseline metrics
- [ ] 5.4 Validate configuration fallback behavior when new options are not provided
- [ ] 5.5 Test configuration loading with various environment combinations (development, production, test)
- [ ] 5.6 Verify thread-safety of new configuration loading mechanisms
- [ ] 5.7 Create integration tests for configuration system with existing components
- [ ] 5.8 Document performance impact analysis and migration recommendations

- `docs/architecture/synthetic-data-architecture.md` - Synthetic data system documentation
- `docs/configuration/multi-frequency-config.md` - Configuration system design
- `docs/migration/single-to-multi-frequency.md` - Migration guide

### Implementation Files (To Be Modified)
- `src/core/services/config_manager.py` - Enhanced configuration loading
- `src/infrastructure/data_sources/factory.py` - Multi-frequency provider support
- `config/multi_frequency_config.json` - JSON configuration schema (to be created)
- `tests/unit/core/test_config_manager.py` - Configuration testing (to be enhanced)

## Sprint 100 Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete architecture documentation covering all current WebSocket and Synthetic data components
- [ ] New configuration system implemented with full backward compatibility
- [ ] JSON schema documentation for all configuration options
- [ ] Configuration validation system with clear error messages
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] No performance regression in current processing pipeline
- [ ] Developer documentation for migrating to new configuration system

## Notes

- This sprint is foundation work for Sprint 101 (WebSocket Multi-Frequency Implementation)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing environment variables
- Focus on documentation and configuration design, not implementation of multi-frequency processing
- All changes should be additive, not breaking existing functionality
