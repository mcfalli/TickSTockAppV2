- [FAIL] Performance ERROR: column "processing_time_ms" does not exist
- [FAIL] Error Recovery FAILED: System not recovering from bad events

### End-to-End Pattern Flow

- [PASS] Published pattern with flow_id: 07c96f0e-272c-465f-b3da-d1055a4979f5
- [PASS] Published daily tier pattern: HeadShoulders for TSLA
- [PASS] Published intraday tier pattern: VolumeSurge for NVDA
- [PASS] Published combo tier pattern: SupportBreakout for AAPL
- [PASS] Sent 40 patterns in 0.4s
- [FAIL] Test failed: column "processing_time_ms" does not exist

## Expected Test Coverage

These integration tests validate:

1. **Redis Integration**
   - Active subscription to `tickstock.events.patterns`
   - Publisher count verification
   - Message delivery confirmation

2. **Event Processing**
   - Pattern event structure compatibility
   - Nested data structure handling
   - Field name flexibility (pattern/pattern_name)

3. **Database Integration**
   - Integration events logging
   - Flow UUID tracking
   - Processing time measurements
   - Checkpoint logging

4. **Pattern Flow**
   - Multi-tier patterns (Daily/Intraday/Combo)
   - NumPy data serialization
   - High-volume processing (40+ patterns/minute)
   - End-to-end latency tracking

5. **Monitoring**
   - 60-second heartbeat intervals
   - Subscription health checks
   - Performance metrics collection

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Test Time | <10 seconds | [MISSED] |
| Pattern Processing | <100ms per event | Check logs |
| Database Logging | <50ms per checkpoint | Check logs |
| WebSocket Delivery | <100ms end-to-end | Check logs |
