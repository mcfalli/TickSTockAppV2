# Process Task List: Sprint 101 WebSocket Multi-Frequency Implementation

## Implementation Protocol

This document tracks the implementation of Sprint 101 tasks following the task management protocol:

- **One sub-task at a time**: Do NOT start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol**: Mark sub-tasks as [x] when completed, run tests after parent task completion, commit with conventional format
- **Stop after each sub-task** and wait for user approval

## Current Status

**Next Task to Execute:** 1.1 - Implement multi-frequency subscription management with concurrent connection support

- [ ] Integration tests verify multi-frequency data flow end-to-end

## Dependencies

- **Sprint 100**: Multi-frequency configuration system must be completed first
- **Polygon Business Plan**: Required for FMV event access and testing (see 101-polygon-reference.md for authentication details)
- **Pull Model Architecture**: Must maintain existing event flow control patterns
- **Thread Safety**: Critical for concurrent stream processing without interference
- **Polygon API Documentation**: Reference `101-polygon-reference.md` for complete event schemas, authentication requirements, and subscription formats
- **reference documentation**: .\docs\architecture\synthetic-data-architecture.md and .\docs\architecture\websocket-architecture.md

## Risk Mitigation

- **Stream Isolation**: Implement proper error boundaries to prevent cascade failures
- **Memory Management**: Careful buffer management for multiple concurrent streams
- **Performance Impact**: Continuous monitoring to ensure no degradation of existing functionality
- **Configuration Complexity**: Comprehensive validation and clear error messages for multi-frequency setups
