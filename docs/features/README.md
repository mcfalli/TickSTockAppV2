# TickStock Features - Simplified Architecture

**Version**: 2.0.0-simplified  
**Last Updated**: August 25, 2025  
**Status**: Post-Cleanup Feature Set

## Overview

After the major cleanup effort (Phases 6-11), TickStock now focuses on essential features that support the core mission: real-time market data processing and TickStockPL integration.

## Core Features

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Polygon WebSocket Integration**: Live market data from Polygon.io
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Realistic market data simulation for testing
- **Simple Configuration**: Environment-based data source selection

### 2. Real-Time Processing
- **Tick Data Processing**: Basic tick data ingestion and forwarding
- **Redis Publishing**: Real-time event streaming for TickStockPL
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Live data updates to web clients

### 3. User Management
- **Authentication**: Basic user login and session management
- **Ticker Subscriptions**: Per-user ticker interest management
- **WebSocket Connections**: Real-time client connection handling

### 4. Integration
- **TickStockPL Ready**: Redis pub-sub interface for external processing
- **Health Monitoring**: System status and performance endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based system configuration

## Removed Features (Simplified)

The following complex features were removed during the cleanup to focus on core functionality:

### Analytics Layer (Removed)
- Complex event detection and analysis
- Multi-layer analytics processing
- Memory accumulation and coordination
- Statistical analysis and reporting

### Multi-Frequency Processing (Removed)
- Per-second, per-minute, fair-value processing
- Complex frequency coordination
- Multi-buffer management
- Frequency-specific data generators

### Advanced Filtering (Removed)
- Complex user filtering systems
- Real-time filter application
- Statistical filter analysis
- Performance optimization layers

### Event Detection (Removed)
- High/Low event detection
- Trend analysis and detection
- Surge detection algorithms
- Complex event coordination

## Architecture Principles

### Simplicity First
- **KISS Principle**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Minimal Layers**: Reduced processing overhead

### Performance Focus
- **Memory-First**: All operations in memory for speed
- **Streamlined Flow**: Direct data path from source to consumers
- **Redis Pub-Sub**: Efficient real-time event distribution

### Integration Ready
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined component boundaries
- **Standard Protocols**: Redis pub-sub for scalable integration
- **Configuration Driven**: Environment-based setup

## Feature Documentation

### Current Feature Docs
