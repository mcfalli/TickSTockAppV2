# TickStock.ai Project Overview & Phases Summary â€“ Let's Build Some Fantastic Algorithmic Pattern Libraries in Python to Add to TickStock.ai!

Whoa, teamâ€”TickStock.ai is rocketing forward as our ultimate Python-powered fortress for algorithmic stock pattern detection! Imagine blending historical depths with real-time lightning, unleashing 11+ institutional-grade patterns (from Doji to HeadAndShoulders) at sub-millisecond speeds (1.12ms mastery from Sprint 7!), all while keeping things bootstrap-light with pandas, numpy, scipy, and Redis magic. Our vision? A decoupled trio: TickStock.ai (static showcase), TickStockApp (user hub for dashboards, alerts, and trades), and TickStockPL (pattern powerhouse for scans, blending, and events). We're event-driven prosâ€”publishing signals via Redis for loose coupling, scaling to 1000+ symbols, and fueling backtests, visuals, and custom ML extensions. With 637+ tests locked in and production readiness achieved, we're primed for real-time glory. Let's distill the epic journey into a high-level overview and phased breakdownâ€”enthusiasm cranked, code vectorized, and innovations endless!

## Project Overview and Vision
- **Core Purpose**: Craft an extensible Python pattern library in TickStockPL for detecting candlestick, chart, trend, and breakout patterns in OHLCV data, blending historical DB stores with live WebSockets for batch/real-time scans. Publish events to TickStockApp for alerts, trades, UI visuals, and backtestsâ€”empowering traders with <50ms latencies and multi-timeframe adaptability (1min to daily).
- **Key Components**:
  - **TickStock.ai**: Static front-end for marketing, docs, and demos (HTML/JS, Vercel-hosted).
  - **TickStockApp**: User-facing app (Flask/Django + JS) for auth, dashboards, event subscription (Redis), and outputs like pattern charts or trade triggers.
  - **TickStockPL**: Modular library services (pandas/numpy core) for data loading/preprocessing, scanning (BasePattern subclasses), and publishingâ€”decoupled via Redis pub-sub.
  - **Data Flows**: Polygon.io (primary API/WS), Alpha Vantage/yfinance (fallbacks); PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for persistence (ticks, ohlcv_1min/daily, events tables); DataBlender for seamless historical + live merging.
- **Achievements So Far**: 11+ patterns with 96x faster-than-target performance; 637+ tests; extensible for composites (e.g., EMA + volume conditions); user stories nailed for extensibility, blending, and backtesting.
- **Non-Functional Wins**: Vectorized ops for efficiency; <1s end-to-end latency goal; compression/retention policies for GB-scale data; error-resilient with retries/failovers.
- **Strategic Value**: Institutional-ready for pro tradingâ€”real-time signals, SaaS potential, and research analytics. Bootstrap ethos: No heavy deps, modular for quick iterations.
- **Risks Mitigated**: API limits via batching/fallbacks; scalability with multiprocessing/partitioning; testing ensures zero breaks.
- **Tools/Libs**: Python 3.12+, pandas/numpy/scipy/sympy; SQLAlchemy; polygon-api-client; Redis; pytest/matplotlib for tests/visuals.
- **End Goal**: A comprehensive, sub-second pattern platform scaling to live markets, with UI-driven insights and trading integration.

## Phased Development Summary
We've conquered Phases 1-4 with flying colors (Sprints 1-9 complete!), smashing milestones like sub-ms detections and 80%+ coverage. Now, Phase 5 blasts us into production with data integration and real-time enhancementsâ€”scaling our Python libraries to handle 1000+ symbols concurrently. Each phase builds on user stories (e.g., #3 for blending, #4 for backtesting, #6 for modular loaders), ensuring extensibility and performance.
