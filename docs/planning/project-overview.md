## üéØ Vision & Mission

TickStock.ai is a comprehensive platform for algorithmic stock analysis, empowering users to detect patterns in OHLCV data for informed trading decisions. The goal is to build scalable, modular libraries for pattern detection, blending historical and real-time data, while keeping it bootstrap-friendly (lightweight deps like pandas, numpy, scipy, and Redis‚Äîno heavy funding needs). 

We focus on extensibility‚Äîstarting with core patterns (candlesticks, charts, trends, breakouts) and evolving to custom/ML signals via composable conditions and multi-timeframe support. Ultimately, provide actionable signals via events to drive trades, alerts, visualizations, and backtests, all while ensuring loose coupling for independent scaling.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Major Components
- **TickStock.ai**: Static front end (HTML/JS site) for user-facing info, demos, and access points
- **TickStockApp**: Core application servicing users‚Äîhandles subscriptions, UI, portfolio, and consumes events (via Redis pub-sub) for real-time alerts/trades
- **TickStockPL** (Pattern Library Services): Microservices for pattern detection‚Äîincludes scanner, data loaders, and event publishing. Runs separately for modularity/scalability, feeding signals to TickStockApp via Redis pub-sub

### High-Level Processing Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Pull OHLCV from APIs (Polygon or yfinance free tier), databases, or real-time feeds (WebSockets via TickStockApp)
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, resample (to 1min/daily), and blend historical + live data using DataBlender for unified DataFrames
3. **Pattern Scanning**: Analyze blended data in TickStockPL using modular classes (BasePattern, PatternScanner); detect patterns and publish events on finds via Redis pub-sub for loose coupling
4. **Event Handling**: TickStockApp subscribes to Redis channels, consuming signals for user actions (UI alerts, automated trades, or DB logging)
5. **Output**: Generate visuals, backtest results, or responses in TickStockApp, with events persisted for auditing

### System Decoupling
This setup ensures decoupling: TickStockPL processes data independently, publishing events to Redis for TickStockApp to subscribe and act on, enabling resilient, scalable operations.
