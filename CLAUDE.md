## About TickStock

### What is TickStock?
TickStock is a high-performance, real-time market data processing system that handles 4,000+ stock tickers with sub-millisecond event detection. It processes WebSocket data streams from Polygon.io (production) or synthetic data (development) and delivers personalized, filtered market events to users via WebSocket connections.

### Core Value Proposition
- Real-time processing of market data with <100ms end-to-end latency
- Zero event loss through Pull Model architecture
- Per-user filtering and personalization
- **Sprint 10 Complete**: Full TickStockPL integration with backtesting platform and pattern alerts

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, Eventlet
- **Frontend**: JavaScript ES6+ SPA with Socket.IO client
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series data
- **Cache**: Redis for user preferences, TickStockPL integration, and pub-sub messaging
- **Data Provider**: Polygon.io (live) / Synthetic (dev/test)
- **Architecture**: Component-based with Pull Model + TickStockPL Integration via Redis

- **app_readwrite** â†’ Database user for application

## Architecture & Design

### Critical Architecture Patterns

#### Pull Model (Sprint 29) - MUST MAINTAIN
- DataPublisher collects and buffers events (no emission)
- WebSocketPublisher pulls when ready (controls flow)
- Zero event loss guaranteed
- Buffer overflow protection (1000 events/type max)

#### Event Type Boundary
- Detection â†’ Worker: Typed Events (HighLowEvent, TrendEvent, SurgeEvent)
- Worker â†’ Display Queue: Dict conversion via `to_transport_dict()`
- Display Queue â†’ Frontend: Dict only
- **Never mix typed events and dicts after Worker conversion**

#### Memory-First Processing
- All operations in memory for sub-millisecond performance
- Database sync every 10 seconds (500:1 write reduction)
- Redis for user preferences and universe caching

### Core Development Philosophy
**Comprehensive Guidelines**: See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for complete development philosophy, design principles, and coding best practices.

#### Key Principles
- **KISS**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- **YAGNI**: Build features only when needed
- **DRY**: Avoid code duplication through abstraction
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose

## Code Standards & Quality

### Code Structure & Style
**Comprehensive Style Guide**: See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for complete code structure, modularity guidelines, Python style standards, and naming conventions.

#### Key Standards
- **File Limits**: Max 500 lines per file, 50 lines per function
- **Style**: PEP 8 with real-time financial system adaptations
- **Naming**: snake_case functions, PascalCase classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints for all functions

### Documentation Standards
**Comprehensive Documentation Guide**: See `docs/instructions/code-documentation-standards.md` for complete documentation standards, Google-style docstrings, and inline comment guidelines.

#### Key Requirements
- **Module Documentation**: Every module needs purpose docstring
- **Function Documentation**: Complete Google-style docstrings for public functions
- **Inline Comments**: Use `# Reason:` prefix for complex logic
- **Documentation Files**: Update date/time and sprint info when modified

### Error Handling & Logging
**Complete Implementation Guides**: See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for comprehensive error handling patterns, logging strategies, and configuration management standards.

#### Key Patterns
- **Custom Exceptions**: Domain-specific exception hierarchy for market data errors
- **Context Managers**: Proper resource management for connections and external services
- **Domain Logging**: Structured logging with performance and error tracking
- **Pydantic Config**: Type-safe environment variable management with validation

### Common Development Tasks
**Detailed Task Guides**: See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for complete development task workflows, database schema patterns, and implementation guidelines.


## Testing & Reliability

### Testing Framework
***TickStock uses a comprehensive testing strategy with pytest for quality assurance and performance verification.***

**Comprehensive Testing Guidelines**: See `docs/instructions/unit_testing.md` for complete testing standards, organization structure, sprint requirements, and best practices.

**Testing Agents**: Comprehensive testing is provided by multiple specialized agents:
- **`tickstock-test-specialist`**: Automated test generation and quality assurance for TickStock processing components
- **`integration-testing-specialist`**: Cross-system testing for TickStockApp â†” TickStockPL communication via Redis

These agents are automatically invoked when creating features, fixing bugs, or modifying core processing components to ensure comprehensive test coverage following TickStock standards.

#### Key Testing Principles
- **Quality First**: No feature is complete without tests
- **Performance Critical**: Sub-millisecond processing requires performance validation
- **Functional Organization**: Tests organized by business domain (event_processing, data_processing, etc.)
- **Sprint-Specific**: Each sprint creates tests in appropriate functional area with sprint subfolders
- **Agent-Assisted**: Automated test generation through specialized testing agent

### Quality Assurance
**Comprehensive Guidelines**: See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for complete quality standards, code review guidelines, and common pitfalls.

#### Key DON'Ts and DOs
- **DON'T**: Mix event types after Worker boundary, exceed size limits, skip tests
- **DO**: Maintain Pull Model, use memory/cache for hot paths, write comprehensive tests
- **Architecture**: Always maintain event type consistency and zero event loss

## Development Workflow

### Sprint Management
- **Sprint Capacity Monitoring**: Alert at 80% chat capacity
- **Context Preservation**: Capture all relevant context before chat transitions
- **Task Tracking**: Maintain sprint tasks with ongoing task list for items that arise
- **Specialized Agent Integration**: Multiple specialized agents provide domain expertise:
  - `appv2-integration-specialist` for Sprint 10 UI integration phases
  - `tickstock-test-specialist` for comprehensive test coverage
  - `architecture-validation-specialist` for continuous compliance checking
  - See complete agent list in Specialized Agents section below

### Git Workflow
#### Branch Strategy
- **main** - primary repository

#### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<body>
<footer>
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Example**:
```

### AI Development Tasks
Use these files when structured feature development is requested using PRD or Sprint:
- `tasks/templates/create-prd.md`
- `tasks/templates/generate-tasks.md`
- `tasks/templates/process-task-list.md`

### Communication Protocol
When working on sprints/problems:
- Repeat understanding of goals in response
- Analyze and summarize the approach
- Ask clarifying questions before generating code
- Provide clear directions with code examples
- Track additional items that arise during sprint work
- Leverage specialized agents for domain-specific tasks (see Specialized Agents section below)

## Important Operating Guidelines

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
- **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** when adding new patterns or dependencies
- **Follow all development standards** - See Development Standards & Processes section above
- **Document your decisions** - Future developers (including yourself) will thank you

### Search Command Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of traditional `grep` and `find` commands. See `docs/instructions/coding-practices.md` for complete search command patterns and examples.
