# Unit Testing Framework Implementation PRD

## Objective
Introduce a comprehensive unit testing framework for TickStock that provides fast, reliable, and maintainable test coverage while aligning with the existing architecture patterns.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ pytest already configured with coverage
- ✅ Test directory structure exists (unit/, integration/, performance/)
- ✅ Some integration tests exist for trace analysis
- ❌ No proper unit tests for core business logic
- ❌ No testing patterns/guidelines documented
- ❌ Tests scattered in scripts/dev_tools/ instead of proper test structure

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Organization
- **Central Location**: `/tests/` directory (current structure is good)
- **Mirror Structure**: Test organization mirrors `src/` structure
- **Test Types**:
  - `unit/` - Fast, isolated component tests
  - `integration/` - Multi-component interaction tests
  - `performance/` - Load and timing tests

### 2. Test Placement Philosophy
- **Co-located with functionality** for discoverability
- **Mirrored directory structure** in `/tests/unit/`
- **Shared test utilities** in `/tests/fixtures/`

### 3. Coverage Priorities
1. **Core Domain Logic** - Event classes, detectors, processors
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic in services/
3. **Infrastructure** - Data providers, database access
4. **Presentation** - WebSocket publishers, converters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Framework Setup
- Enhanced pytest configuration
- Test utilities and fixtures
- Mock data generators
- Test runner scripts

### Phase 2: Core Domain Tests
- Event classes (BaseEvent, HighLowEvent, etc.)
- Event detectors (highlow, surge, trend)
- Event processors and pipeline

### Phase 3: Service Layer Tests
- Universe management
- Analytics coordination
- User filters and settings

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Tests
- Data providers (Polygon, Synthetic)
- Database models and repositories
- Cache management

### Phase 5: Integration & Performance
- End-to-end flow testing
- WebSocket communication
- Performance benchmarks

## Testing Patterns & Standards

### Unit Test Structure
```python
def test_<component>_<action>_<expected_result>():
    # Arrange
    # Act  
    # Assert
```

### Mock Strategy
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, database)
- Use real objects for domain logic
- Prefer dependency injection for testability

### Fixtures
- Market data generators
- Event builders
- Database test data
- Mock user sessions

## Success Criteria
- 80%+ code coverage on core business logic
- Sub-100ms test suite execution time
- All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- Clear test documentation and examples
