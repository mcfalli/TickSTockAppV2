# TickStock Code Documentation Standards

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation standards for TickStock codebase  
**Audience**: Development teams, code reviews, maintenance  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  

## Documentation Philosophy

Clear, comprehensive documentation is essential for TickStock's real-time market data system. Every service, processor, and event handler needs clear documentation to ensure maintainability and team collaboration.

---

## Code Documentation Requirements

### Module Documentation
- **Every module should have a docstring** explaining its purpose and role in the system
- Include module-level imports and dependencies
- Describe key classes, functions, and constants defined in the module

### Public Function Documentation
- **Public functions must have complete docstrings** using Google style
- Include comprehensive parameter descriptions
- Document return values and types
- List all possible exceptions that may be raised
- Provide usage examples for complex functions

### Complex Logic Documentation
- **Complex logic should have inline comments** with `# Reason:` prefix to explain the rationale
- Document algorithmic decisions and business logic
- Explain performance considerations and trade-offs
- Include references to external documentation or specifications

---

## Google-Style Docstring Standards

**Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules:**

```python
def detect_surge_event(
    ticker: str,
    current_volume: float,
    avg_volume: float,
    threshold_multiplier: float = 3.0
) -> Optional[SurgeEvent]:
    """
    Detect volume surge events in market data.

    This function analyzes current trading volume against historical averages
    to identify significant volume surges that may indicate market events.

    Args:
        ticker: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT")
        current_volume: Current period volume in shares
        avg_volume: Average volume for comparison period in shares
        threshold_multiplier: Surge detection threshold (default 3x)

    Returns:
        SurgeEvent if surge detected, None otherwise. SurgeEvent contains
        ticker, timestamp, volume metrics, and surge magnitude.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If volumes are negative or threshold < 1.0
        DataProviderError: If market data unavailable or invalid

    Example:
        >>> surge = detect_surge_event("AAPL", 5000000, 1000000)
        >>> if surge:
        ...     websocket_manager.broadcast_event(surge)
        
    Note:
        Volume surge detection uses exponential moving averages for 
        baseline calculation to reduce noise in volatile markets.
    """
```

## Class Documentation Standards

### Class Docstrings
```python
class MarketDataService:
    """
    Core service for processing real-time market data streams.
    
    This service orchestrates the ingestion, processing, and distribution
    of market data from multiple sources (Polygon.io, synthetic data) to
    WebSocket clients with sub-millisecond latency requirements.
    
    The service implements the Pull Model architecture where DataPublisher
    buffers events and WebSocketPublisher controls emission timing to
    prevent event loss and maintain system stability.
    
    Attributes:
        data_publisher: Handles event collection and buffering
        websocket_publisher: Controls event emission to clients
        event_processor: Processes raw ticks into market events
        
    Performance:
        - Processes 4,000+ tickers simultaneously
        - <100ms end-to-end latency requirement
        - Zero event loss through Pull Model buffer management
        
    Example:
        >>> service = MarketDataService(config)
        >>> service.start_processing()
        >>> service.subscribe_ticker("AAPL", user_id="123")
    """
```

### Method Documentation
```python
def process_tick_data(self, tick_data: TickData) -> List[Event]:
    """
    Process incoming tick data and generate market events.
    
    Analyzes tick data for high/low events, trends, and volume surges
    using configurable detection algorithms optimized for real-time
    processing with sub-millisecond performance requirements.
    
    Args:
        tick_data: Raw tick data containing price, volume, timestamp
        
    Returns:
        List of detected events (HighLowEvent, TrendEvent, SurgeEvent).
        Empty list if no events detected.
        
    Raises:
        EventDetectionError: If detection algorithm fails
        DataValidationError: If tick data is invalid or corrupted
        
    Performance:
        Average processing time: <0.5ms per tick
        Memory usage: <1MB per 10,000 ticks
        
    Note:
        Events are returned as typed objects, not transport dicts.
        Use to_transport_dict() for WebSocket transmission.
    """
```

## Documentation File Standards

### Documentation File Headers
When creating or updating documentation in the docs folder:

```markdown
# Document Title

**Purpose**: Brief description of document purpose  
**Audience**: Target audience (developers, ops, etc.)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  
**Sprint**: Sprint 108 - Integration & Testing (if applicable)  

Content follows...
```

### Folder-Level Documentation
- **Keep folder level README.md files updated** with setup instructions and examples
- Include quick start guides for developers
- Document folder structure and file organization
- Provide links to related documentation

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Update date and time** at the top of files when modified  
- **Add sprint information** when documentation relates to specific sprint work
- **Keep documentation current** with code changes
- **Remove obsolete documentation** rather than letting it become misleading

---

## Inline Comment Standards

### Comment Prefixes
Use specific prefixes for different types of comments:

```python
# Reason: Using exponential moving average to reduce noise in volatile markets
ema_volume = calculate_ema(historical_volumes, alpha=0.1)

# TODO: Implement caching for frequently accessed ticker data  
# FIXME: Handle edge case where volume is exactly zero
# NOTE: This algorithm is optimized for sub-millisecond performance
# WARNING: Modifying this threshold affects all surge detection globally
```

### Performance Comments
Document performance considerations:

```python
# Performance: This loop processes 4000+ tickers in <50ms
for ticker in active_tickers:
    process_ticker_events(ticker)
    
# Memory: Buffer limited to 1000 events to prevent memory leaks
if event_buffer.size() > MAX_BUFFER_SIZE:
    event_buffer.clear_oldest(100)
```

### Business Logic Comments
Explain business decisions and financial domain knowledge:

```python
# Market hours: NYSE regular session 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
# Pre-market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM EST, After-hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST
if not market_calendar.is_market_open(timestamp):
    apply_extended_hours_processing(tick_data)
    
# Reason: Volume surges during first 30 minutes are often algorithmic
# and should use different thresholds than regular trading hours
if is_market_opening_period(timestamp):
    threshold_multiplier *= OPENING_SURGE_ADJUSTMENT
```

---

## API Documentation Standards

### REST Endpoint Documentation
```python
@app.route('/api/events/<ticker>', methods=['GET'])

    Example:
        GET /api/events/AAPL?limit=50&event_type=surge
    """
```

### WebSocket Event Documentation
```python
class HighLowEvent(BaseEvent):
    """
    High or low price event for WebSocket transmission.
    
    Represents a significant price movement that breaks recent 
    high or low levels within the configured time window.
