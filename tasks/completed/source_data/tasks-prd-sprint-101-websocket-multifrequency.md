### Notes

- Sprint 101 builds on Sprint 100's configuration foundation
- Must maintain existing Pull Model architecture and zero event loss guarantees
- Thread safety critical for concurrent stream processing
- Integration with Polygon's different event schemas (T, AM, FMV)
- **Reference Document**: See `101-polygon-reference.md` for complete Polygon API specifications, event schemas, and authentication requirements
- **reference documentation**: .\docs\architecture\synthetic-data-architecture.md and .\docs\architecture\websocket-architecture.md
