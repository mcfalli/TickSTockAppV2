# Sprint 31: Status Update - INTEGRATION ON HOLD

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Sprint Status**: **ON HOLD - Integration Incomplete**
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Integration Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete

## Current Situation

### What's Complete ‚úÖ
- **Monitoring Dashboard UI**: Fully implemented with Bootstrap 5 and canvas gauges
- **Redis Subscriber Service**: Active and listening on `tickstock:monitoring` channel
- **API Endpoints**: All monitoring endpoints implemented and working
- **Event Storage**: Internal event storage mechanism functional
- **Frontend JavaScript**: Auto-refresh and interactive features working

### Integration Issue üî¥
Despite TickStockPL and TickStockAppV2 running integrated, the monitoring events are **not flowing** from TickStockPL to the dashboard. The monitoring subscriber is active but not receiving events.

### Symptoms
- Monitoring subscriber shows: "Successfully subscribed to Redis channel"
- No METRIC_UPDATE events being received
- No CPU/Memory metrics appearing in dashboard
- TickStockPL monitoring service status unknown

## Sprint Placed ON HOLD

### Reason for Hold
The monitoring dashboard cannot be fully validated without real data from TickStockPL. The integration path between TickStockPL's monitoring publisher and TickStockAppV2's subscriber needs investigation.

### Blocking Issues
1. **No monitoring events** received on `tickstock:monitoring` channel
2. **Integration path unclear** - need to verify TickStockPL is publishing
3. **Cannot validate** alert lifecycle without real events

## Work Completed Before Hold

### Sprint 31 Deliverables
- ‚úÖ 1,800+ lines of monitoring code
- ‚úÖ 9 API endpoints implemented
- ‚úÖ Real-time dashboard with gauges
- ‚úÖ Alert management system
- ‚úÖ Manual action triggers
- ‚úÖ 100% real implementation (no mocks)

### Test Infrastructure Created
- ‚úÖ Integration test script
- ‚úÖ Event simulator for testing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test backlog
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

## Next Steps When Resumed

### Priority 1: Debug Integration
1. Verify TickStockPL monitoring service is running
2. Check Redis channel for published events
3. Debug subscriber connection and event flow
4. Validate event format compatibility

### Priority 2: Complete Testing
1. Run full integration test with real events
2. Validate CPU/memory metrics display
3. Test alert lifecycle
4. Performance testing under load

### Priority 3: Production Prep
1. Fix minor issues (RLock warning, fallback detector)
2. Update CORS configuration
3. Complete security review
4. Create deployment guide

## Items to Investigate

### TickStockPL Side
- Is monitoring service actually running?
- Are events being published to Redis?
- What channel/format is being used?
- Any errors in TickStockPL logs?

### TickStockAppV2 Side
- Subscriber confirmed active
- Correct channel subscribed (`tickstock:monitoring`)
- Event handler registered and working
- Store endpoint functional

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: **LOW** - Feature is isolated and non-critical
- Does not affect core trading functionality
- Can be debugged independently
- All code is complete and tested locally

## Sprint Metrics

### Time Investment
- **Development**: 2 days
- **Testing**: 0.5 days
- **Documentation**: 0.5 days
- **Total**: 3 days

### Code Quality
- **Lines Added**: ~1,800
- **Test Coverage**: Pending
- **Technical Debt**: None introduced
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## Recommendation

**HOLD sprint until TickStockPL team can:**
1. Confirm monitoring service is active
2. Verify events are publishing to Redis
3. Provide sample event for format validation

Once integration path is confirmed, sprint can be completed in <1 day.
