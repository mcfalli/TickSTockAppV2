# Sprint 102: Synthetic Data Enhancement & Documentation

## Introduction/Overview

This sprint completes the multi-frequency data source implementation by enhancing the synthetic/simulated data providers to generate realistic data for all supported frequencies (per-second, per-minute, fair market value) and delivering comprehensive documentation for the entire multi-frequency system. This ensures development and testing can occur with realistic data patterns that match production characteristics across all frequency types.

**Problem it solves:** Enables comprehensive testing and development of multi-frequency features without requiring expensive Polygon Business plan access, while providing developers with complete documentation for configuration and usage of the multi-frequency system.

## Goals

1. **Multi-Frequency Synthetic Data**: Generate realistic synthetic data for per-second ticks, per-minute aggregates, and fair market value streams
2. **Realistic Data Patterns**: Simulate market session behaviors, volume patterns, and price correlations across frequencies
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Deliver complete configuration guides, architecture documentation, and developer resources
4. **Testing Foundation**: Provide robust synthetic data for testing all multi-frequency scenarios
5. **Developer Experience**: Ensure developers can easily configure, test, and debug multi-frequency implementations

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want realistic synthetic per-minute aggregate data so that I can test aggregation processing logic without live market data
2. **As a QA engineer**, I want synthetic fair market value data so that I can test FMV processing without requiring Business plan access
3. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive configuration documentation so that I can quickly set up different testing scenarios
4. **As a system architect**, I want detailed architecture documentation so that I can understand the complete multi-frequency data flow
5. **As a new team member**, I want clear developer guides so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the multi-frequency system

## Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-Frequency Synthetic Generators**
   1.1. Enhance SimulatedDataProvider to support frequency-specific generation
   1.2. Implement PerSecondGenerator maintaining existing functionality and compatibility
   1.3. Implement PerMinuteGenerator creating realistic OHLCV bars from synthetic tick data
   1.4. Implement FMVGenerator producing fair market value updates at configurable intervals
   1.5. Support market session awareness (pre-market, regular, after-hours) for all generators
   1.6. Implement configurable volatility and trend patterns across frequencies

2. **Realistic Data Correlation**
   2.1. Ensure per-minute aggregates mathematically align with underlying per-second ticks
   2.2. Generate fair market value data that correlates with current price movements
   2.3. Implement volume patterns that match frequency characteristics (higher volume per-minute vs per-second)
   2.4. Create realistic price movement patterns across different time horizons
   2.5. Support configurable market conditions (trending, sideways, volatile)

3. **Configuration Integration**
   3.1. Integrate with Sprint 100's configuration system for synthetic data control
   3.2. Support frequency-specific generation parameters (update rates, volatility, trends)
   3.3. Enable independent start/stop of different frequency generators
   3.4. Implement configuration-driven ticker selection per frequency
   3.5. Support realistic data timing that matches market session schedules

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   4.1. Provide synthetic data builders for unit tests across all frequencies
   4.2. Create realistic market scenario generators for integration testing
   4.3. Implement data validation utilities to verify synthetic data quality

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Changes to production WebSocket processing logic
- Frontend user interface modifications
- Database schema changes or analytics enhancements  
- Real-time performance optimization beyond current levels
- Integration with additional data providers beyond Polygon
- Machine learning or AI-based synthetic data generation

## Design Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing synthetic data usage
- Follow existing patterns in SimulatedDataProvider architecture
- Ensure synthetic data is mathematically consistent across frequencies
- Use realistic market timing and session behaviors
- Consider memory usage with multiple concurrent synthetic streams
- Design for easy expansion to additional frequency types in the future

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate with configuration system from Sprint 100
- Must work with multi-frequency WebSocket implementation from Sprint 101
- Thread safety required for concurrent synthetic stream generation
- Proper timing control to simulate realistic market data rates
- Integration with existing DataProviderFactory patterns
- Consider synthetic data storage/caching for consistent test scenarios

## Success Metrics

1. **Data Quality**: Synthetic data passes mathematical consistency checks across frequencies
2. **Testing Coverage**: All multi-frequency scenarios testable with synthetic data
3. **Documentation Completeness**: 100% configuration options documented with examples
4. **Developer Onboarding**: New developers can set up multi-frequency testing environment in <30 minutes
5. **Performance Consistency**: Synthetic data generation maintains same performance characteristics as existing implementation
6. **Realistic Behavior**: Synthetic market sessions, volume patterns, and price correlations match expected market characteristics

## Documentation Deliverables

1. **Configuration Guide**
   - Complete environment variable reference with examples
   - JSON configuration schema with real-world scenarios
   - Migration guide from single to multi-frequency configuration
   - Troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues

2. **Architecture Documentation**  
   - Updated data flow diagrams including multi-frequency paths
   - Sequence diagrams for parallel stream processing
   - Component interaction diagrams with synthetic and WebSocket data sources

3. **Developer Guide**
   - API documentation for frequency-specific handlers
   - Testing strategies and patterns for multi-frequency scenarios  
   - Debugging guide for multi-stream processing issues
   - Code examples for adding new frequency types
   - Synthetic data configuration examples and best practices

## Open Questions

1. Should synthetic data generation be deterministic by default or include randomness?
2. What level of market realism is needed (order book simulation, market maker behavior)?
3. Should synthetic data support historical replay scenarios for testing?
4. How should synthetic data handle edge cases like market halts or data gaps?
5. Should there be performance benchmarking tools for comparing synthetic vs. real data processing?
