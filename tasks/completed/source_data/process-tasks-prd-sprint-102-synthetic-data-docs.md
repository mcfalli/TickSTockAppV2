# Process Task List: Sprint 102 Synthetic Data Enhancement & Documentation

## Implementation Protocol

This document tracks the implementation of Sprint 102 tasks following the task management protocol:

- **One sub-task at a time**: Do NOT start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol**: Mark sub-tasks as [x] when completed, run tests after parent task completion, commit with conventional format
- **Stop after each sub-task** and wait for user approval

## Current Status
