# Sprint 27: Pattern Alert Management System

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Status**: Planning

## Sprint Objectives

Implement comprehensive pattern alert system with user-configurable thresholds, multi-channel delivery, and intelligent filtering based on market context and user preferences.

## Alert System Architecture

### Multi-Layered Alert Processing
```
TickStockPL Pattern Events → Alert Rules Engine → Delivery System → User Notifications
                                      ↓
                             Market Context Filter
                                      ↓  
                            User Preference Filter
                                      ↓
                            Delivery Channel Router
```

## Implementation Components

### 3.1 Alert Configuration Engine

**Core Services**:
```python
src/core/services/pattern_alert_manager.py         # Main alert orchestration
src/core/domain/alerts/alert_rules.py              # Alert rule definitions
src/core/domain/alerts/alert_conditions.py         # Condition matching logic
src/core/domain/alerts/alert_priority_engine.py    # Priority and urgency calculation
src/infrastructure/database/models/user_alerts.py # Alert storage models
```

**Alert Rule Features**:
- **Pattern-Type Rules**: Alerts for specific pattern types (Bull Flag, Weekly Breakout, etc.)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum confidence levels per pattern type
- **Symbol Watchlists**: Alerts only for user-selected symbols
- **Market Context Rules**: Alerts conditional on market regime (Bull/Bear/Neutral)
- **Tier-Specific Rules**: Different rules for Daily/Intraday/Combo patterns
- **Volume Conditions**: Minimum relative volume requirements
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Market hours, session-specific alerts

### 3.2 Alert Delivery System

**Delivery Services**:
```python
src/core/services/alert_delivery_service.py        # Multi-channel delivery orchestrator
src/core/services/websocket_alert_service.py       # Real-time browser alerts
src/core/services/email_alert_service.py           # Email notification service
src/core/services/alert_history_service.py         # Alert tracking and history
```

**Delivery Channels**:
- **WebSocket Real-Time**: Uses `UniversalWebSocketManager` for instant browser notifications
- **Email Notifications**: Configurable frequency (immediate, digest, daily summary)
- **Database History**: Complete alert audit trail with delivery confirmation
- **Mobile Push Ready**: Architecture prepared for mobile app notifications

## WebSocket Integration

This feature integrates with the core WebSocket architecture documented in `docs/architecture/websocket-scalability-architecture.md`.

### Pattern Alert WebSocket Integration
```python
class PatternAlertWebSocketIntegration:
    def __init__(self, websocket_manager: UniversalWebSocketManager):
        self.websocket = websocket_manager
        
    def subscribe_user_to_alerts(self, user_id: str, alert_rules: List[AlertRule]):
        """Subscribe user to pattern alerts based on their rules"""
        filters = {
            'pattern_types': self._extract_pattern_types(alert_rules),
            'symbols': self._extract_symbols(alert_rules),
            'confidence_min': self._get_min_confidence(alert_rules),
            'alert_urgency': ['HIGH', 'CRITICAL']  # Only high-priority alerts via WebSocket
        }
        
        return self.websocket.subscribe_user(user_id, 'pattern_alerts', filters)
    
    def broadcast_pattern_alert(self, alert: AlertMessage):
        """Broadcast alert to specific user"""
        targeting = {
            'subscription_type': 'pattern_alerts',
            'user_id': alert.user_id,  # Target specific user
            'urgency': alert.urgency.value
        }
        
        return self.websocket.broadcast_event('pattern_alert', alert.to_dict(), targeting)
```

**Alert Formatting**:
```python
@dataclass
class AlertMessage:
    alert_id: str
    user_id: str
    pattern_type: str
    symbol: str
    confidence: float
    current_price: float
    market_context: str
    urgency: AlertUrgency     # LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
    delivery_channels: List[str]
    expires_at: datetime
    
    def to_websocket_format(self) -> Dict:
        """Format for real-time browser alerts"""
        
    def to_email_format(self) -> Dict:
        """Format for email notifications"""
```

### 3.3 Alert Management UI

**Frontend Components**:
```javascript
web/static/js/components/alert_management.js           # Main alert management interface
web/static/js/components/alert_rules_builder.js        # Drag-and-drop rule builder
web/static/js/components/alert_preview.js              # Rule preview and testing
web/static/js/components/alert_history.js              # Alert history and performance
web/static/js/components/alert_settings.js             # User alert preferences
web/static/js/services/alert_service.js                # Alert API communication
```

**User Interface Features**:
- **Visual Rule Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating alert conditions
- **Pattern Type Selector**: Visual pattern selection with examples and descriptions
- **Confidence Sliders**: Interactive confidence threshold setting per pattern
- **Watchlist Integration**: Symbol selection from user watchlists
- **Market Context Toggle**: Enable/disable market regime-based filtering
- **Delivery Preferences**: Channel selection and frequency settings
- **Alert Testing**: Preview alerts with sample data before activation

## Alert Logic Framework

### Alert Rule Structure
```python
@dataclass
class AlertRule:
    rule_id: str
    user_id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    
    # Pattern Criteria
    pattern_types: List[str]           # Which patterns to monitor
    confidence_min: float              # Minimum confidence threshold
    confidence_max: float = 1.0        # Maximum confidence (for filtering)
    
    # Symbol Criteria  
    symbols: List[str]                 # Specific symbols (empty = all)
    watchlist_ids: List[str]           # User watchlists to monitor
    exclude_symbols: List[str]         # Symbols to exclude
    
    # Market Context Criteria
    market_regimes: List[str]          # Bull, Bear, Neutral
    risk_levels: List[str]             # Low, Medium, High risk environments
    sector_conditions: Dict[str, str]  # Sector-specific conditions
    
    # Timing Criteria
    market_sessions: List[str]         # Pre-market, Market Hours, After Hours
    time_filters: List[TimeWindow]     # Specific time windows
    
    # Volume and Technical Criteria
    min_relative_volume: float = 1.0   # Minimum relative volume
    min_price: float = 0.0             # Minimum stock price
    max_price: float = float('inf')    # Maximum stock price
    
    # Delivery Settings
    delivery_channels: List[str]       # websocket, email, mobile
    urgency_override: Optional[str]    # Override calculated urgency
    
    # Rule Status
    active: bool = True
    created_at: datetime
    last_triggered: Optional[datetime]
    trigger_count: int = 0
```

### Alert Priority Calculation
```python
def calculate_alert_priority(pattern_event: Dict, market_context: Dict, 
                           user_preferences: Dict) -> AlertUrgency:
    """
    Calculate alert urgency based on multiple factors:
    
    HIGH PRIORITY:
    - High confidence patterns (>0.8) in user watchlist
    - Combo tier patterns (multi-timeframe confirmation)
    - Patterns aligned with market regime
    - Breakout patterns with high volume
    
    MEDIUM PRIORITY:  
    - Medium confidence patterns (0.6-0.8)
    - Daily tier patterns in trending markets
    - Patterns with strong relative volume
    
    LOW PRIORITY:
    - Lower confidence patterns (0.5-0.6)
    - Intraday patterns in choppy markets
    - Patterns counter to market regime
    """
```
