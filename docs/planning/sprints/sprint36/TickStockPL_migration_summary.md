# Sprint 36: Cache Reorganization Migration Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: Ready for TickStockPL Implementation

## Overview

The Cache Entries Synchronization system is being migrated from TickStockAppV2 (consumer) to TickStockPL (producer) where it belongs as a data processing job.

## What is Being Migrated

A daily job that manages the `cache_entries` table, organizing 4000+ stocks into logical universes based on:
- Market capitalization (mega, large, mid, small, micro cap)
- Rankings (top 100, 500, 1000, 2000)
- Sectors and themes
- IPO status
- Active/delisted status

## Current Impact

- **Database**: Reads from `symbols` and `ohlcv_daily`, writes to `cache_entries`
- **Runtime**: 5-30 minutes depending on data size
- **Frequency**: Should run daily after market close data import
- **Dependencies**: Requires completed OHLCV data for market cap calculations

## Migration Package Contents

This folder contains everything needed for the migration:

### ðŸ“„ Documents Provided

1. **`TickStockPL_cache_reorganization_migration.md`**
   - Complete migration instructions
   - Architecture overview
   - Integration points
   - Timeline expectations

2. **`TickStockPL_implementation_guide.md`**
   - Detailed code implementation guide
   - Function-by-function migration
   - Database operations
   - Redis event publishing

3. **`TickStockPL_RETURN_THIS_COMPLETED.md`**
   - Template for TickStockPL developer to complete
   - Must be returned as `TickStockAppV2_integration_callback.md`
   - Contains integration details needed for TickStockAppV2

4. **`test_cache_entries_synchronizer.py`**
   - Reference test file from original implementation
   - Shows expected behavior and test cases

## Integration Points

### For TickStockPL:
- Add as Phase 2.5 in daily processing (after data import, before indicators)
- Expose API endpoints for manual triggering
- Publish Redis events for progress tracking
- Integrate with job progress tracker

### For TickStockAppV2:
- Will call TickStockPL API instead of local function
- Subscribe to Redis events for progress updates
- Update admin interface to show remote job status

## Success Criteria

âœ… Migration complete when:
1. Cache sync runs successfully in TickStockPL
2. API endpoints are accessible from TickStockAppV2
3. Redis events flow correctly between systems
4. Performance is acceptable (<30 minutes)
5. Old code can be safely removed from TickStockAppV2

## Timeline

- **TickStockPL Implementation**: 2-3 days
- **Testing & Integration**: 1-2 days
- **TickStockAppV2 Cleanup**: 1 day
- **Total**: ~1 week

## Action Required

1. **TickStockPL Developer**:
   - Implement using provided guides
   - Complete and return `TickStockPL_RETURN_THIS_COMPLETED.md`

2. **TickStockAppV2 Team** (after callback received):
   - Update admin interface to use new API
   - Remove old synchronizer code
   - Test complete integration

## Files to be Deleted from TickStockAppV2

After successful migration:
- `src/data/cache_entries_synchronizer.py` (881 lines)
- `src/core/services/cache_entries_synchronizer.py`
- `scripts/cache_management/run_cache_synchronization.py`
- Related test files

## Questions?

Contact the TickStockAppV2 team for clarification on:
- Database schema
- Cache entries structure
- Expected behavior
- Redis event formats

**Note**: This is a clean architectural improvement, moving data processing from the consumer (AppV2) to the producer (PL) where it belongs.
