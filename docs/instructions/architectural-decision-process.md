# Architectural Decision Process Guide

**Purpose**: Process guide for creating, reviewing, and documenting Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)  
**Audience**: Technical leads, architects, senior developers, sprint teams  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  

## Overview

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made for TickStock's real-time market data processing system. This process ensures decisions are well-considered, documented, and can be revisited as the system evolves.

## When to Create an ADR

### Mandatory ADR Situations
- **Architecture Changes**: Modifications to core system architecture or data flow
- **Technology Adoption**: Introduction of new frameworks, libraries, or external services
- **Performance Decisions**: Choices affecting sub-millisecond processing requirements
- **Integration Patterns**: New approaches to component integration or communication
- **Data Model Changes**: Modifications to event structures or data schemas
- **Scalability Decisions**: Changes affecting system capacity (4,000+ tickers)

### Recommended ADR Situations
- **Design Pattern Selection**: Choice between competing design patterns
- **Trade-off Decisions**: Decisions involving significant trade-offs between competing concerns
- **Compliance Requirements**: Decisions driven by security, regulatory, or operational requirements
- **Cross-Sprint Dependencies**: Decisions that affect multiple sprints or teams

### ADR Threshold Guidelines
Create an ADR if the decision:
- Cannot be easily reversed (high switching cost)
- Affects multiple components or services
- Has significant performance, security, or maintainability implications
- Requires team alignment and understanding
- May be questioned or revisited in the future

## ADR Format and Template

### Standard ADR Structure

```markdown
### ADR-[Sprint].[Number]: [Decision Title]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Status:** [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]  
**Participants:** [Decision makers and key contributors]

**Context:**  
[Description of the problem or opportunity that requires a decision. Include relevant background, constraints, and requirements specific to TickStock's real-time processing needs.]

**Decision:**  
[The decision made, described clearly and concisely. Include key implementation details and rationale.]

**Alternatives Considered:**  
[Other options evaluated, with brief explanation of why they were not chosen]

**Consequences:**  
**✅ Positive:**
- [Beneficial outcomes and advantages]
- [Performance improvements or other gains]

**❌ Negative:**  
- [Costs, risks, or disadvantages]
- [Technical debt or maintenance implications]

**Dependencies:**  
[Any prerequisites or related work required]

**Performance Impact:**  
[Specific impact on sub-millisecond processing requirements, if applicable]

**Implementation Notes:**  
[Key implementation details, configuration requirements, or deployment considerations]
```

### ADR Numbering System
- Format: `ADR-[Sprint].[Sequential Number]`
- Example: `ADR-107.1`, `ADR-107.2`, `ADR-108.1`
- Sprint numbers align with development sprints
- Sequential numbering within each sprint

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Problem Identification
- **Clear Problem Statement**: Define the specific problem or opportunity
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Identify who is affected by the decision
- **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful outcome
- **Constraints**: Document technical, business, and performance constraints

### 2. Research and Analysis
- **Option Generation**: Brainstorm and research potential solutions
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Assess technical feasibility of each option
- **Performance Impact**: Evaluate impact on sub-millisecond processing requirements
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Consider implementation cost vs. expected benefits

### 3. Stakeholder Consultation
- **Technical Review**: Consult with relevant technical experts
- **Team Input**: Gather input from development team members
- **Architecture Review**: Validate alignment with overall system architecture
- **Sprint Planning Impact**: Consider impact on current and future sprint work

### 4. Decision Documentation
- **Draft ADR**: Create initial ADR using the standard template
- **Review Process**: Submit for review by relevant stakeholders
- **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback and additional analysis
- **Final Documentation**: Complete final ADR with all required sections

---

## Review and Approval Process

### Review Participants
- **Technical Lead**: Primary architectural oversight
- **Sprint Team**: Development team implementing the decision
- **Performance Specialist**: For decisions affecting system performance
- **Integration Specialist**: For decisions affecting system integration

### Review Criteria
- **Technical Soundness**: Is the decision technically sound and implementable?
- **Performance Impact**: Will this maintain sub-millisecond processing requirements?
- **Maintainability**: Does this improve or degrade system maintainability?
- **Alignment**: Does this align with overall system architecture and goals?
- **Risk Assessment**: Are the risks acceptable and properly mitigated?

### Approval Process
1. **Draft Review**: Initial review for completeness and clarity
2. **Technical Review**: Deep technical evaluation by relevant experts
3. **Team Discussion**: Open discussion with development team
4. **Final Approval**: Formal approval by technical lead or architect
5. **Documentation**: Publication to `docs/architecture/architectural_decisions.md`

### Review Timeline
- **Standard Decisions**: 2-3 business days for review
- **Critical Decisions**: Same-day or next-day review for urgent decisions
- **Complex Decisions**: Up to 1 week for decisions requiring extensive analysis

---

## ADR Lifecycle Management

### Status Transitions
- **Proposed**: Initial state when ADR is created and under review
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implementation can proceed
- **Implemented**: Decision has been implemented in the codebase
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

### Updating ADRs
- **Status Updates**: Update status as decisions progress through lifecycle
- **Implementation Notes**: Add notes about actual implementation experience
- **Performance Results**: Document actual performance impact after implementation
- **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights gained during implementation

### ADR Maintenance
- **Regular Review**: Quarterly review of all active ADRs for relevance
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate actual vs. expected outcomes
- **Superseding Process**: Create new ADRs that supersede outdated decisions
- **Historical Value**: Maintain deprecated ADRs for historical reference

## Integration with Development Process

### Sprint Planning Integration
- **Decision Identification**: Identify architectural decisions needed during sprint planning
- **ADR Creation**: Create ADRs for significant architectural work in sprint
- **Implementation Tracking**: Track ADR implementation as part of sprint deliverables
- **Review Scheduling**: Schedule ADR reviews to avoid blocking sprint work

### Code Review Integration
- **ADR References**: Reference relevant ADRs in pull requests for architectural changes
- **Compliance Check**: Verify implementation follows documented architectural decisions
- **Update Triggers**: Identify when code changes require ADR updates or new ADRs

### Documentation Integration
- **Cross-References**: Link ADRs to related design documents and technical specifications
- **Update Coordination**: Update related documentation when ADRs are created or modified
- **Knowledge Base**: Ensure ADRs are discoverable through documentation index

## Quality Guidelines

### ADR Quality Checklist
- [ ] Clear, concise problem statement
- [ ] Decision is clearly articulated
- [ ] Alternatives considered and documented
- [ ] Consequences (positive and negative) identified
- [ ] Performance impact assessed for relevant decisions
- [ ] Implementation guidance provided
- [ ] Review feedback incorporated
- [ ] Status and dates current

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Vague Decisions**: Avoid ambiguous language that could be interpreted differently
- **Missing Context**: Don't assume readers understand the background problem
- **Ignoring Trade-offs**: Acknowledge negative consequences and risks
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't create ADRs for trivial or easily reversible decisions
- **Outdated Information**: Keep status and implementation notes current
