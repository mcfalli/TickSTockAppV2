# Redis Integration Specialist Agent Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the specific changes proposed for the `redis-integration-specialist.md` agent to focus on intraday streaming service integration and architectural expectations based on Sprint 42 and integration testing challenges.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Sprint 42 Architecture Documentation (NEW)**
**Location**: Domain Expertise section

**Added**:
- **Producer/Consumer Separation**: Clear definition of TickStockAppV2 (consumer) vs TickStockPL (producer) roles
- **Critical Timing Requirement**: Explicit documentation that first OHLCV bar completes after 60+ seconds
- **Expected Behavior**: `messages_processed = 0` is EXPECTED for tests shorter than 60 seconds

**Why This Matters**:
- Eliminates confusion about "no messages processed" during short tests
- Clarifies that TickStockAppV2 NO LONGER creates OHLCV bars (Sprint 42 Phase 2)
- Sets proper expectations for integration testing timelines

**Example**:
```markdown
**CRITICAL TIMING REQUIREMENT**: First OHLCV bar completes after 60+ seconds.
Tests shorter than 60 seconds will show `messages_processed = 0` for
pattern/indicator jobs - **THIS IS EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**.
```

---

### 2. **Intraday Streaming Integration Validation (NEW)**
**Location**: New major section after Domain Expertise

**Added**:
- **Tick Flow Validation**: Expected log patterns for both TickStockAppV2 and TickStockPL
- **Validation Commands**: Redis CLI commands to monitor tick flow in real-time
- **Validation Queries**: SQL queries to verify bar creation (with timing expectations)
- **Bar Aggregation Validation**: Critical timing requirements and expected flow timeline

**Why This Matters**:
- Provides concrete commands for validating integration health
- Sets clear expectations for what logs indicate success vs failure
- Gives developers specific tools to diagnose integration issues

**Example**:
```bash
# Monitor tick flow in real-time
redis-cli SUBSCRIBE tickstock:market:ticks

# Check message count on channel
redis-cli PUBSUB NUMSUB tickstock:market:ticks

# Verify OHLCV bars created by TickStockPL
SELECT symbol, bar_timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume
FROM ohlcv_bars_1min
WHERE bar_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
ORDER BY bar_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### 3. **Integration Testing Methodology (NEW)**
**Location**: After Intraday Streaming Integration Validation

**Added**:
- **Minimum Test Duration**: 120 seconds (2 minutes) with justification
- **Test Script Template**: Complete bash script for integration testing
- **Success Criteria**: Checklist of what indicates successful integration
- **Failure Diagnosis**: How to interpret common failure patterns

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents developers from running 2-second tests and claiming "integration broken"
- Provides reproducible test methodology
- Clarifies what "success" looks like at different time intervals

**Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_streaming_integration.sh

echo "Running for 120 seconds to allow bar completion..."
sleep 120

# Query database for bars created
psql -d tickstock -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ohlcv_bars_1min
WHERE bar_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '2 minutes';"
```

---

### 4. **Enhanced Channel Documentation (UPDATED)**
**Location**: TickStock.ai Redis Ecosystem section

**Changed**:
- Split channels into **INBOUND** (AppV2 → PL), **OUTBOUND** (PL → AppV2), and **JOB** channels
- Added `tickstock:market:ticks` as primary inbound channel (Sprint 40/42)
- Added `tickstock.events.indicators` to outbound channels
- Added `tickstock:errors` for Sprint 32 error integration

**Why This Matters**:
- Clarifies data flow direction (critical for architecture validation)
- Highlights the Sprint 42 tick publisher channel
- Shows complete channel ecosystem including indicators and errors

**Example**:
```python
# TickStockAppV2 → TickStockPL (Raw Market Data)
INBOUND_CHANNELS = {
    'market_ticks': 'tickstock:market:ticks',  # Raw tick data from Polygon/Synthetic
}

# TickStockPL → TickStockAppV2 (Processed Results)
OUTBOUND_CHANNELS = {
    'patterns': 'tickstock.events.patterns',       # Completed pattern detections
    'indicators': 'tickstock.events.indicators',   # Completed indicator calculations
}
```

---

### 5. **Message Format Updates (UPDATED)**
**Location**: Message Format Standards section

**Added**:
- **Raw Tick Message**: TickStockAppV2 → TickStockPL tick format (Sprint 40/42)
- **Indicator Event Message**: TickStockPL → TickStockAppV2 indicator format
- Updated pattern event to include `bar_timestamp` in metadata

**Why This Matters**:
- Documents the actual message format used in Sprint 40/42 integration
- Provides examples for developers implementing publishers/subscribers
- Shows metadata fields needed for UI display

**Example**:
```python
# Published to: tickstock:market:ticks
market_tick = {
    'type': 'market_tick',
    'symbol': 'AAPL',
    'price': 150.25,
    'volume': 1000,
    'timestamp': 1697385600.123,
    'source': 'polygon'  # Data source (polygon|synthetic)
}
```

---

### 6. **Code Examples Updated (UPDATED)**
**Location**: Redis Integration Patterns section

**Changed**:
- Renamed `TickStockEventPublisher` to `TickPublisher` (reflects AppV2 role)
- Changed example from publishing pattern events to publishing raw ticks
- Added tick counting and monitoring example
- Updated `TickStockEventSubscriber` to include indicator handling

**Why This Matters**:
- Code examples now match Sprint 42 architecture (tick publisher, not pattern publisher)
- Shows proper monitoring patterns for tick flow
- Demonstrates how to handle both patterns AND indicators

**Example**:
```python
class TickPublisher:
    """Publishes raw tick data to TickStockPL streaming service"""

    def publish_tick(self, tick_data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Publish raw tick to TickStockPL for aggregation"""
        market_tick = {
            'type': 'market_tick',
            'symbol': tick_data['ticker'],
            'price': tick_data['price'],
            'volume': tick_data.get('volume', 0),
            'timestamp': tick_data['timestamp'],
            'source': tick_data.get('source', 'polygon')
        }
        self.redis_client.publish('tickstock:market:ticks', message)
```

### 7. **Anti-Patterns Expanded (UPDATED)**
**Location**: Anti-Patterns and Best Practices section

**Added**:
- ❌ **Testing for <60 seconds and expecting pattern jobs to trigger** (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **TickStockAppV2 creating OHLCV bars** (removed in Sprint 42)
- ❌ **TickStockAppV2 writing patterns/indicators to database** (consumer role only)

**Added to Best Practices**:
- ✅ **Run integration tests for 120+ seconds minimum** (CRITICAL)
- ✅ **Validate tick flow before checking bar creation** (sequence matters)
- ✅ **Use database queries to confirm bar persistence** (source of truth)
- ✅ **Monitor both publisher and subscriber logs** (bidirectional validation)

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents the exact issues encountered in recent integration testing
- Codifies lessons learned from Sprint 42 debugging
- Sets proper architectural boundaries for TickStockAppV2

---

### 8. **Architectural Expectations Checklist (NEW)**
**Location**: New section at end of document

**Added**:
- **Phase 1: Tick Flow Validation** (0-30 seconds)
- **Phase 2: Bar Aggregation Validation** (60-90 seconds)
- **Phase 3: Pattern/Indicator Job Validation** (90-120 seconds)
- **Phase 4: End-to-End Validation** (120+ seconds)

**Why This Matters**:
- Provides time-based validation checklist
- Shows what to expect at each phase of testing
- Prevents premature failure diagnosis (e.g., checking for patterns at 30 seconds)

**Example**:
```markdown
### **Phase 1: Tick Flow Validation (0-30 seconds)**
- [ ] TickStockAppV2 log shows "Processed {N} ticks, Published {N} events"
- [ ] TickStockPL log shows "Processed {N} ticks from Redis" (N should match AppV2)

### **Phase 2: Bar Aggregation Validation (60-90 seconds)**
- [ ] TickStockPL log shows "TickAggregator created minute bar for {SYMBOL}"
- [ ] Database query shows bars in ohlcv_bars_1min table
```

---

### 9. **Documentation References Updated (UPDATED)**
**Location**: Integration with TickStock Components section

**Added**:
- Reference to `planning/sprints/sprint42/SPRINT42_COMPLETE.md` - Sprint 42 streaming architecture

**Why This Matters**:
- Links agent to specific Sprint 42 documentation
- Provides context for architectural decisions
- Helps developers understand the evolution from pre-Sprint 42 to current architecture
