## üîÑ Documentation Evolution

### What Changed (2025-08-30)
- **Reorganized Structure**: Moved technical architecture to `../architecture/`
- **Operational Focus**: Moved guides to `../guides/` for better discoverability
- **Planning Focus**: Kept true planning content (vision, requirements, user stories)
- **Cross-References**: Updated all links to reflect new organization
- **Single Sources**: Maintained single sources of truth with clear navigation

### What Remained in Planning
- **Project Vision**: Complete system overview and requirements
- **User Stories**: Development requirements and next phase planning  
- **Pattern Planning**: Pattern library scope and specifications
- **Evolution Tracking**: Documentation catalog and change management
