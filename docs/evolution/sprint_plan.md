# TickStock.ai Sprint Plan

## Phase 1: Design (Sprints 1-3, ~3-4 weeks)
- **Sprint 1: Architecture/Requirements (1 week)**: Define vision, user stories, event-driven flow, data frequencies (tick, 1min, daily). Deliverables: overview.md, architecture_overview.md.
- **Sprint 2: Classes/Patterns (1 week)**: Design `BasePattern`, `ReversalPattern`, scanner classes, pattern specs. Deliverables: pattern_library_architecture.md, patterns.md.
- **Sprint 3: DB/Data Flows (1-2 weeks)**: Schema for ticks/OHLCV, aggregation jobs, data blending. Deliverables: database_architecture.md, data_integration.md.

## Phase 2: Cleanup and Prep (Sprint 4, ~1 week)
- **Sprint 4: Streamline TickStockApp**: Remove outdated components (universe filtering, user filtering, old event detection) from TickStockApp. Refactor processing architecture into a clean shell for new integrations (e.g., WebSockets to TickStockPL, event subscription).
  - **Tasks**:
    - Audit TickStockApp codebase; identify junk (e.g., deprecated filtering logic, legacy event handlers).
    - Remove unused modules; refactor WebSockets handler to align with websockets_integration.md.
    - Streamline to core components: WebSockets/REST ingestion, event subscriber, UI hooks.
    - Document new TickStockApp shell in architecture_overview.md.
  - **Deliverables**: Cleaned TickStockApp codebase, updated docs.

## Phase 3: Implementation (Sprints 5-7, ~3-4 weeks)
- **Sprint 5: Core Patterns/Event Publisher (1 week)**: Code `BasePattern`, `EventPublisher`, 3-5 patterns (e.g., Doji, Hammer). Deliverables: src/patterns/, src/analysis/.
- **Sprint 6: Scanner/Subscriber (1 week)**: Implement `PatternScanner`, `RealTimeScanner`, TickStockApp subscriber. Deliverables: End-to-end scan demo.
- **Sprint 7: Advanced Patterns (1-2 weeks)**: Add reversals (e.g., HeadAndShoulders), Day1Breakout. Deliverables: Full pattern library, examples/.

## Phase 4: Testing (Sprints 8-9, ~2 weeks)
- **Sprint 8: Unit/Integration (1 week)**: Test patterns, scanner, events. Deliverables: tests/ folder, 80% coverage.
- **Sprint 9: E2E/Performance (1 week)**: End-to-end tests, perf metrics (e.g., event latency). Deliverables: Test reports, CI setup.

## Phase 5: Data Integration (Sprints 10-11, ~2 weeks)
- **Sprint 10: DB/Historical Feeds (1 week)**: Setup DB, load historical data (get_historical_data.md). Deliverables: Populated DB.
- **Sprint 11: Real-Time/Blending (1 week)**: Integrate WebSockets, blending logic. Deliverables: Real-time demo.

**Total**: ~9-13 weeks. Adjust based on progress or part-time effort.
