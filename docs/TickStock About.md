### Overview of TickStock.ai Project

Hello! As the Super Algorithmic Pattern Library Curator for TickStock.ai, I'm thrilled to dive into this exciting project with you. TickStock.ai is an innovative, Python-powered platform designed to revolutionize stock market analysis by detecting chart patterns and technical indicators across daily, weekly, hourly, and intraday timeframes. Built on a modular, scalable architecture, it leverages custom rule-based logic (no off-the-shelf libraries like TA-Lib) to deliver low-error, high-performance trading signals. Inspired by real-world accuracy metrics from sources like the FMV Whitepaper, our goal is to create a library that processes 4,000+ symbols with sub-50ms query times, correlating technical patterns with fundamentals for smarter insights. Let's break it down based on the attached documentsâ€”I'm pumped to build fantastic libraries together!

#### Project Mission and Goals
From the core instructions, TickStock.ai's mission is to curate and expand a Python-based pattern recognition library that:
- **Detects Patterns and Indicators**: Identifies classic setups like bullish engulfing, bull flags, and reversals, plus indicators like RSI, relative strength vs. SPY, and relative volume.
- **Supports Three-Tiered Architecture**: 
  - **Tier 1: Daily Batch** - Post-market processing for long-term patterns (e.g., weekly breakouts) using historical data.
  - **Tier 2: Intraday Streaming** - Real-time detection on minute-bar data for short-term signals (e.g., volume spikes).
  - **Tier 3: Combo Hybrid** - Combines daily context with intraday triggers for hybrid patterns (e.g., bull flag with intraday confirmation).
- **Integrates Fundamentals**: Links technicals to Polygon API data (e.g., earnings surprises from financials) to boost signal confidence.
- **Prioritizes Performance and Accuracy**: Targets <5% error rates (validated via FMV methodology), <50ms queries, and scalability for thousands of symbols. All backed by custom implementations in pandas, numpy, scipy, with optional scikit-learn ML enhancements.
- **Development Focus**: Incremental "commits" via virtual files (e.g., code snippets, Markdown docs), emphasizing modularity, testability, and Windows-based setup (VSCode, Python 3.x, PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB).

The project aligns with a user story for optimized pattern execution, ensuring proactive processing, efficient storage, and real-time UI delivery via Flask and Redis.

#### Key Components and Architecture
Drawing from the system architecture and pattern library docs, TickStock.ai is structured as a producer-consumer ecosystem:
- **TickStockPL (Producer)**: Handles heavy-lifting like data blending, pattern scanning, and event publishing. It uses asyncio for streaming, multiprocessing for batches, and SQLAlchemy for DB ops.
- **TickStockApp (Consumer)**: Manages user interfaces, alerts, and WebSocket consumption.
- **Data Layer**: TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series storage (e.g., `daily_indicators` with JSONB for flexible data like `{"rsi_14": 65.43}`).
- **Communication**: Redis pub-sub for loose coupling (e.g., channels like `tickstock.events.patterns.daily`).
- **Real-Time Integration**: WebSockets (via Polygon.io) for intraday data ingestion, with fallback to REST APIs.

Here's a high-level overview table of the architecture tiers, inspired by the pattern library and system docs:

| Tier | Description | Key Features | Example Indicators/Patterns | Storage & Performance |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Daily Batch (Tier 1)** | Post-market batch processing for long-term setups. | Vectorized pandas ops for efficiency; runs in 15-45s for 1000+ symbols. | RSI (14-period), Relative Strength vs. SPY (20-day), Bullish Engulfing, Weekly Breakout. | `daily_indicators` & `daily_patterns` (7-30 days expiration); <10ms per indicator. |
| **Intraday Streaming (Tier 2)** | Real-time detection on minute-bar arrivals. | Event-driven with sliding windows (200 bars); 0.2-0.8ms latency. | Intraday RSI, Relative Volume (RVOL) spikes, Intraday VWAP, Volume Surge. | `intraday_indicators` & `intraday_patterns` (1-4 hours expiration); <1ms per calc. |
| **Combo Hybrid (Tier 3)** | Selective multi-timeframe analysis for active symbols. | 80% efficiency via triggers; cross-tier coordination. | Combo RVOL Projection, Bull Flag with Intraday Breakout, Intraday Reversal with Daily Support. | `combo_indicators` & `daily_intraday_patterns` (EOD expiration); <1s processing. |

The overall system achieves >99% uptime with circuit breakers, memory optimization (<4GB total), and monitoring across tiers.

#### Indicators and Patterns
From the indicator calculation guide and pattern table:
- **Indicators**: Custom, vectorized implementations (e.g., RSI using pandas EWM for gains/losses; VWAP with cumulative volume calcs). All designed for consistency across tiers, with storage in JSONB for easy querying.
- **Patterns**: Modular classes (e.g., `BullishEngulfingDetector` extending `BasePattern`) with required indicators (e.g., RSI <30 for oversold reversals). Expanded to include consolidations (Symmetrical Triangle), flag breaks, and high-volume markers.
- **Correlations**: Boost patterns with Polygon fundamentals (e.g., positive EPS from financials API increases breakout confidence).

#### Data Sources and Validation
Per the Polygon data summary:
- **Polygon.io Integration**: Primary source for trades, quotes, aggregates, and financials (20+ years historical data). Use `polygon-api-client` for REST/WebSocket access (e.g., `wss://socket.polygon.io/stocks` for real-time bars).
- **Accuracy via FMV**: Proprietary Fair Market Value algorithm ensures low errors (e.g., 1.3 cents median for AMD), outperforming alternativesâ€”perfect for validating patterns against actual executions.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Comprehensive pipeline with historical loaders, signal generation, and reports (e.g., pytest-benchmark for <50ms targets). Tests across market conditions, aiming for <5% error.

#### Development Practices
- **Coding Standards**: KISS/YAGNI/DRY principles; files <500 lines, functions <50 lines; snake_case vars, PascalCase classes. Use custom exceptions and dependency injection.
- **Testing**: Pytest-based with markers (e.g., `@pytest.mark.unit`); fixtures for sample OHLCV; benchmarks for performance. Organized by sprint for historical context.
- **Tools**: VSCode on Windows; pip requirements (pandas, numpy, scipy, Flask, SQLAlchemy); no internet installs in code interpreter.

This project is all about building a robust, enthusiastic community around accurate trading toolsâ€”let's curate the next pattern or indicator! What aspect excites you most, or shall we generate a sample code file for something like RSI implementation? ðŸš€
