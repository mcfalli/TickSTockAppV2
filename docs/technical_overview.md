# TickStock Technical Overview - Simplified Architecture

**Version**: 2.0.0-simplified  
**Last Updated**: August 25, 2025  
**Status**: Post-Cleanup Technical Summary

## Executive Summary

TickStock has been transformed from a complex, over-engineered system into a streamlined, maintainable application optimized for TickStockPL integration. The system now focuses on essential functionality: real-time market data processing and event distribution via Redis pub-sub.

## System Architecture

### Simplified Data Flow
```
Market Data → Basic Processing → Redis Pub-Sub → WebSocket Clients
     ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓
  Polygon/Synthetic TickData    Event Streaming  Real-time UI
  Simple Config    Basic Stats  TickStockPL      User Management
```

### Core Components (3 vs. 17+ previously)

#### 1. Market Data Service
- **File**: `src/core/services/market_data_service.py` (232 lines)
- **Purpose**: Central orchestration for tick data processing
- **Responsibilities**: Data ingestion, Redis publishing, service lifecycle

#### 2. Data Publisher  
- **File**: `src/presentation/websocket/data_publisher.py` (181 lines)
- **Purpose**: Redis-based event publishing for TickStockPL
- **Responsibilities**: Event buffering, Redis pub-sub, basic statistics

#### 3. WebSocket Publisher
- **File**: `src/presentation/websocket/publisher.py` (243 lines)
- **Purpose**: Real-time WebSocket emission to clients
- **Responsibilities**: User management, subscription handling, live updates

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: <50ms end-to-end (previously complex multi-layer processing)
- **Throughput**: 25-50 ticks/second configurable (synthetic), market-speed (Polygon)
- **Memory Usage**: Dramatically reduced through simplification
- **CPU Efficiency**: Streamlined processing with minimal overhead

### Data Sources
- **Polygon.io**: WebSocket integration for live market data
- **Synthetic**: Realistic market data simulation for testing/development
- **Configuration**: Simple environment-based source selection

### Integration Interface

#### Redis Pub-Sub
- **Primary Channel**: `tickstock.all_ticks` for all data streaming
- **Per-Ticker**: `tickstock.ticks.{TICKER}` for selective consumption
- **Message Format**: Standardized JSON with ticker, price, volume, timestamp

```json
{
  "event_type": "tick_data",
  "ticker": "AAPL", 
  "price": 150.25,
  "volume": 1000,
  "timestamp": 1693123456.789,
  "source": "polygon",
  "market_status": "REGULAR"
}
```

## Major Simplifications Achieved

### Removed Complex Systems (~14,300+ lines)
- ✅ **Event Detection Layer**: 17+ specialized detection components
- ✅ **Analytics Systems**: Memory accumulation, coordination, processing

### Architecture Transformation
- **Before**: 6+ processing layers, 25,000+ lines, extensive coordination
- **After**: 3 simple components, ~11,000 lines, clean linear flow

### Code Reduction Summary
| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Data Sources | 2,100+ lines | Simplified | ~84% |
| WebSocket System | 5,936 lines | 964 lines | 84% |
| Core Services | 10,144 lines | 3,749 lines | 63% |
| App.py | 1,062 lines | 252 lines | 76% |

## TickStockPL Integration

### Integration Benefits
- **Clean Interface**: Simple Redis pub-sub for real-time data consumption
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple TickStockPL instances
- **Fault Tolerance**: Redis persistence and clustering support
- **Flexible Consumption**: Subscribe to all data or specific tickers

### Implementation Example
```python
import redis
import json

redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)
subscriber = redis_client.pubsub()
subscriber.subscribe('tickstock.all_ticks')

for message in subscriber.listen():
    if message['type'] == 'message':
        tick_data = json.loads(message['data'])
        # Process with TickStockPL algorithms
        process_market_data(tick_data)
```
