# TickStock.ai Pattern Library Development Plan

## Phase 1: Design (Sprints 1-3, ~3-4 weeks)
Phase 1: Design (Sprints 1-3, ~3-4 weeks) Objective: Create a thorough blueprint for the pattern library, covering requirements, classes, and data flows to guide implementation without rework. Goal: Establish extensibility and alignment with TickStockApp's event-driven flow, ensuring patterns support multiple timeframes and real-time blending. Outcome: Comprehensive docs (e.g., updated patterns.md, architecture_overview.md) with pseudocode, diagrams, and user stories; ready for cleanup and coding. Milestone: Full design review confirms scope for 5-7 initial patterns.

Sprint 1: Architecture & Requirements Definition (1 week) Objective: Define high-level system needs, user stories, and non-functional reqs (e.g., latency <50ms). Goal: Set the vision for pattern signals integrating with TickStockApp's UI, prioritizing bootstrap-friendly constraints. Outcome: Fleshed-out overview.md and requirements.md; basic diagrams in architecture_overview.md.
Sprint 2: Pattern Classes & Specifications Design (1 week) Objective: Blueprint core classes (BasePattern, PatternScanner) and initial patterns (prioritize candlesticks like Doji). Goal: Ensure reusability and timeframe adaptability, with event metadata for signals. Outcome: Pseudocode stubs in src/patterns/; updated patterns.md with edge cases.
Sprint 3: Database Schema & Data Flow Architecture (1-2 weeks) Objective: Detail DB tables (ticks, ohlcv_1min/daily) and flows (loaders, blenders, aggregations), with optional early DB validation. Goal: Support seamless historical/real-time blending for pattern accuracy. Outcome: SQL scripts and pseudocode in database_architecture.md and data_integration.md; basic DB test setup if risks identified.

## Phase 2: Cleanup & Prep (Sprint 4, ~1 week)
Phase 2: Cleanup & Prep (Sprint 4, ~1 week) Objective: Gut outdated TickStockApp components to create a lean integration shell. Goal: Remove bloat (e.g., old filtering, legacy events) for smooth WebSockets forwarding to TickStockPL and event subscription. Outcome: Refactored TickStockApp codebase; validated basic data pass-through. Milestone: TickStockApp ready as data hub.

Sprint 4: TickStockApp Cleanup & Refactoring (1 week) Objective: Audit and remove junk (universe/user filtering, old detectors); refactor WebSockets for TickStockPL integration. Goal: Streamline to focus on ingestion and signal consumption, aligning with our event-driven redesign. Outcome: Clean shell with updated docs in architecture_overview.md; basic forwarding tests.

## Phase 3: Implementation (Sprints 5-7, ~3-4 weeks)
Phase 3: Implementation (Sprints 5-7, ~3-4 weeks) Objective: Build the core library and scanner for pattern detection and events. Goal: Create extensible code that starts with basics and scales to advanced patterns, ensuring low-latency publishing. Outcome: Working prototypes (e.g., scan demos); full pattern library. Milestone: End-to-end pattern-to-event flow with mock data.

Sprint 5: Core Pattern Library & Event Publisher (1 week) Objective: Implement BasePattern and 3-5 candlesticks (e.g., Doji, Hammer); add EventPublisher for Redis. Goal: Establish foundational detection and publishing for quick signal testing. Outcome: Code in src/patterns/ and src/analysis/; basic publish demo.
Sprint 6: Pattern Scanner & Event Subscriber (1 week) Objective: Code PatternScanner/RealTimeScanner; integrate subscriber in TickStockApp. Goal: Enable batch/incremental scanning with event flow. Outcome: End-to-end scan script in examples/.
Sprint 7: Advanced Pattern Implementation (1-2 weeks) Objective: Add trends (MACrossover), breakouts (Day1Breakout), reversals (HeadAndShoulders). Goal: Round out library for diverse signals across timeframes. Outcome: Updated patterns.md; full library with extensibility notes.
