# Sprint Introduction and PRD Overview
This document serves as your entry point to understand the upcoming work, objectives, and deliverables for this iteration.

## Introduction
Please see the following markdown documents to fully understand the goals of this Sprint/PRD. 
We just finalized 100, 101 and 102 and I would like you to organize the /docs/ folder.  note for 102, the synthetic documentation is correctly
placed within the data_source directory.  there is other documentation both synthetic and related to these sprints that should be found (within docs folder) 
and moved to the /docs/data_source/ folder.  While moving update the top of each file under title "Last edited:" and add the date and time.  If you know
the sprint it is correlated with add another line for "Sprint:" and add the sprint number and sprint short description.
