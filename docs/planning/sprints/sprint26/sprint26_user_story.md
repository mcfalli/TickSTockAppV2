# Sprint 26: User Story
# Pattern Flow Display Transformation

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-19
**Sprint 26**: Detailed User Story with Acceptance Criteria

## Primary User Story

### As a Day Trader
**I want** to see a live feed of detected patterns and indicators updating every 15 seconds, organized in a clear 4-column layout by tier (Daily/Intraday/Combo/Indicators), **so that** I can quickly monitor the latest market developments without manually refreshing or searching through complex filters, enabling me to make time-sensitive trading decisions based on real-time pattern recognition.

## User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Persona: Active Day Trader
**Background**: Trades 4-6 hours daily, monitors 20-50 stocks, makes 10-20 trades per day
**Goals**: Identify patterns as they develop, minimize screen time while maximizing information
**Pain Points**: Current pattern discovery requires too many clicks, misses real-time opportunities

**Use Case**:
"I open TickStock.ai at market open, navigate to Pattern Flow, and leave it running on a second monitor. Every 15 seconds I see new patterns appear at the top of each column. When I see a bull flag on AAPL in the Daily column, I click for details and execute my trading strategy within 30 seconds of pattern detection."

### Secondary Persona: Swing Trader
**Background**: Trades 2-3 times per week, focuses on daily patterns, holds positions 3-10 days
**Goals**: Monitor daily patterns without noise from intraday fluctuations, track combo confirmations
**Pain Points**: Difficulty filtering relevant timeframes, information overload

**Use Case**:
"I check Pattern Flow twice daily - at market open and close. I focus primarily on the Daily and Combo columns, looking for confirmed breakouts and multi-timeframe validations. The automatic updates ensure I don't miss patterns while focusing on other analysis."

### Tertiary Persona: Options Trader
**Background**: Focuses on high-probability setups, uses indicators heavily, trades around events
**Goals**: Monitor RSI, MACD, and volume indicators for entry/exit signals
**Pain Points**: Indicator data scattered across multiple tools, delayed alerts

**Use Case**:
"I keep Pattern Flow open specifically for the Indicators column. When RSI shows oversold conditions combined with support level tests in the other columns, I can quickly identify options opportunities with high probability of success."

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality

#### AC-1: Real-Time Pattern Flow Display
**Given** I am on the Pattern Flow tab
**When** new patterns are detected by TickStockPL
**Then** patterns appear at the top of the appropriate column within 15 seconds
**And** older patterns move down maintaining chronological order
**And** the newest pattern is highlighted briefly to draw attention
**And** no more than 50 patterns are displayed per column

#### AC-2: 4-Column Layout Organization
**Given** I am viewing the Pattern Flow display
**When** patterns of different tiers are detected
**Then** Daily patterns appear in the leftmost column
**And** Intraday patterns appear in the second column
**And** Combo patterns appear in the third column
**And** Indicators appear in the rightmost column
**And** each column has a clear header with tier name and count

#### AC-3: 15-Second Auto-Refresh Cycle
**Given** the Pattern Flow is active
**When** 15 seconds have elapsed since the last refresh
**Then** all columns refresh with the latest pattern data
**And** a countdown timer shows "Next update in: X seconds"
**And** the refresh process completes within 2 seconds
**And** users can manually trigger refresh with a button
**And** refresh pauses when browser tab is not active

### Pattern Display Requirements

#### AC-4: Minimal Row Design
**Given** a pattern is displayed in any column
**When** I view the pattern row
**Then** the row shows stock symbol prominently (16px bold)
**And** relative timestamp (e.g., "2m ago") in smaller text
**And** pattern type with color coding (bull=green, bear=red, neutral=blue)
**And** essential details in condensed format (confidence, key levels)
**And** the entire row is clickable for detailed view

#### AC-5: Pattern Information Hierarchy
**Given** multiple patterns are displayed in a column
**When** I scan the column visually
**Then** high-confidence patterns (>80%) are highlighted
**And** patterns are sorted by timestamp with newest first
**And** pattern types are color-coded consistently
**And** critical patterns (breakouts, major support/resistance) are marked
**And** alternating row backgrounds improve readability

#### AC-6: Interactive Pattern Details
**Given** I click on any pattern row
**When** the pattern details modal opens
**Then** I see complete pattern information including chart
**And** technical details (entry, target, stop-loss levels)
**And** pattern confidence score and validation criteria
**And** related patterns for the same symbol
**And** historical performance data for this pattern type

### Performance Requirements

#### AC-7: WebSocket Real-Time Updates
**Given** TickStockPL detects a new pattern
**When** the pattern event is published to Redis
**Then** the pattern appears in Pattern Flow within 100ms
**And** WebSocket connection status is indicated visually
**And** automatic reconnection occurs on disconnect
**And** fallback to polling works when WebSocket fails

#### AC-8: UI Performance Standards
**Given** patterns are updating frequently
**When** new patterns are added to columns
**Then** UI updates complete within 50ms
**And** no visible flickering occurs during updates
**And** scrolling remains smooth during updates
**And** memory usage stays below 50MB additional
**And** browser responsiveness is maintained

#### AC-9: Mobile Responsiveness
**Given** I access Pattern Flow on a mobile device
**When** viewing the 4-column layout
**Then** columns stack vertically on screens <768px wide
**And** pattern rows remain readable and clickable
**And** touch interactions work smoothly
**And** refresh functionality works with touch
**And** modal dialogs are mobile-optimized

### Data Integration Requirements

#### AC-10: TickStockPL Pattern Consumption
**Given** TickStockPL is generating patterns
**When** patterns are published to Redis channels
**Then** Pattern Flow receives all pattern types correctly
**And** pattern data structure matches expected format
**And** missing or malformed patterns are handled gracefully
**And** pattern deduplication prevents duplicates
**And** cache layer improves performance

#### AC-11: Pattern Type Coverage
**Given** the Pattern Flow is monitoring market data
**When** various pattern types are detected
**Then** Daily patterns include flags, breakouts, formations
**And** Intraday patterns include momentum, volume, support/resistance
**And** Combo patterns include multi-timeframe confirmations
**And** Indicators include RSI, MACD, moving averages, volume
**And** all patterns display with appropriate tier classification

#### AC-12: Error Handling & Fallbacks
**Given** network or data issues occur
**When** pattern data cannot be retrieved
**Then** cached patterns continue to display
**And** error messages are user-friendly and actionable
**And** automatic retry attempts with exponential backoff
**And** fallback to polling when WebSocket unavailable
**And** graceful degradation maintains core functionality

### User Experience Requirements

#### AC-13: Theme Integration
**Given** I have light or dark theme selected
**When** viewing Pattern Flow
**Then** all components respect current theme
**And** pattern colors remain distinguishable in both themes
**And** text contrast meets accessibility standards
**And** animations and transitions work in both themes

#### AC-14: Accessibility Standards
**Given** I use assistive technologies
**When** navigating Pattern Flow
**Then** screen readers can access all pattern information
**And** keyboard navigation works for all interactions
**And** color coding includes additional visual indicators
**And** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is maintained

#### AC-15: User Control & Customization
**Given** I want to customize my Pattern Flow experience
**When** I access settings or preferences
**Then** I can adjust refresh frequency (5s, 15s, 30s, 60s)
**And** maximum patterns per column is set to 50 for optimal performance
**And** I can toggle pattern types on/off per column
**And** my preferences persist across sessions
**And** I can reset to default settings
