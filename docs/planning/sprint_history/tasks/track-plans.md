# This is a document to track past, current and future plans for the application
**to do**: port local document to this format

## Current Plans

## Future Plans
- 111 Configure events to function based on datasource type and frequency.  My sense is this is in place and functional but review with claude.  Ask what datasources are processing events
- Multi-source data.  Create or configure synthetics to run in a multi-source mode at different frequencies to test and assure enabling and disabling sources and frequency works
- Fine tune data source to data display
- clean up noisey logs
- Implement dark mode. alter back and forth from light to dark mode.
- Start up summary and information
- monitoring and tracing
- UI Volume on event grids looks to be from tick vs day value
- UI universe filters remove but document first (embedded removal)
- UI filters remove non-pertinent filters keep core
- Events High Low thorough review
- Events Trending thorough review
- New Algo Engine Design, then implementation
- data storage
- algos
- raise events
- paint events
- go

- search fro this and fix the fact that we do have connected users and this pypass is BS                # TEMPORARY TESTING BYPASS - REMOVE AFTER USER CONNECTION ISSUE FIXED
                


## Past Plans
- 110 Fix Router and Route to front end Event Connection and general flow back to not tripping on itself - result is ok, but functional
- 109 pre router bugs
- 103 thru 108 Multi Router Framework 
- Data Source: update and enhance Synthetica and Massive per-minute processing and multiple sources
