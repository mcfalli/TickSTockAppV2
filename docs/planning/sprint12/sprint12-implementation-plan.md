🎯 Updated Sprint 12 Action Plan

✅ Existing Infrastructure (Already Built)
- GridStack Framework: Fully functional with app-gridstack.js manager
- Index.html Foundation: Located at web/templates/dashboard/index.html
- Theme System: Complete light/dark theme switching
- WebSocket Ready: Socket.IO integration with connection management
- Chart.js Integration: CDN loaded and ready for implementation
- Bootstrap 5.1.3: UI framework already integrated

🚀 Sprint 12 Implementation Steps

Phase 1: Replace Placeholder with Tabbed Interface
Current State: Single placeholder grid item at lines 142-150
<div class="grid-stack-item" data-gs-width="12" data-gs-height="6" data-gs-id="placeholder">
Action 1: Transform Placeholder into Tabbed Hub
- Replace placeholder content with Bootstrap tab structure (reference ui_design_spec.md for wireframes)
- Implement Dashboard, Charts, Alerts tabs
- Maintain grid-stack compatibility for drag/resize
- Ensure accessibility: Add ARIA labels for tabs (per User Story 2.2)
Action 2: Dashboard Tab Implementation
- Watchlist Table: Sortable/filterable symbol list (ties to User Story 3.1)
- Pattern Display: Real-time pattern detection results (limit to 5-7 initial patterns to avoid overwhelm)
- Similar Stocks: Correlated symbols sub-table (ties to User Story 3.2)
- Add/Remove Symbols: Interactive controls (CRUD via API, per User Story 3.3)
Action 3: Charts Tab Integration
- Chart.js Canvas: OHLCV candlestick implementation with pattern overlays (ties to User Story 2.1; prep for Sprint 13 daily focus)
- Pattern Overlays: Visual indicators on charts with tooltips/explanations (ties to User Story 2.2)
- Timeframe Controls: Dropdown for different periods (e.g., daily initial focus)
- Historical Data: Connect to existing data sources (leverage User Story 0.1 for loads)
Action 4: Alerts Tab Development
- Real-time Feed: WebSocket-driven pattern alerts (ties to User Stories 1.1-1.3)
- Filter Controls: Day/swing trader preferences with thresholds (e.g., min confidence)
- Toast Notifications: Visual alert system
- Configuration Panel: Email/SMS setup (placeholder for future integration)

Phase 2: Enhanced GridStack Integration
Action 5: Multi-Panel Grid Layout
- Convert tabs to individual grid-stack items (reference front_end_implementation_guide.md)
- Enable drag-and-drop between panels
- Implement pop-out windows functionality (e.g., window.open() for independent views)
- Maintain existing edit/save layout system
Action 6: Advanced Features
- Customize Button: Unlock advanced grid mode
- Layout Persistence: Extend existing localStorage system (sync to DB for user prefs)
- Responsive Design: Enhance mobile compatibility with stacking on small screens
- Performance Optimization: <1s load, <200ms updates (validate with synthetic data)

Phase 3: Backend Integration
Action 7: WebSocket Event Handlers
- Connect to existing Redis pub-sub channels: `tickstock.events.patterns`, `tickstock.events.alerts`, `tickstock.events.health`
- Handle real-time market updates from TickStockPL (loose coupling: no direct API calls)
- Implement error handling and reconnection logic with UI fallbacks (e.g., 5s retry timeout):
  - WebSocket disconnect: Show "⚠️ Reconnecting..." status, disable real-time features
  - Redis connection lost: Display cached data with "🔄 Offline Mode" indicator
  - Pattern service unavailable: Show "📊 Historical Data Only" mode
- **MANDATORY Agent Usage**: `redis-integration-specialist` for pub-sub implementation
Action 8: API Endpoints  
- Watchlist Management: CRUD operations for user symbols (store in TimescaleDB user_watchlists)
- Historical Data: Chart data retrieval (from ohlcv_daily/1min via DataBlender)
- User Preferences: Theme and layout settings (read-only DB access per architecture_overview.md)
- Read-only Database: Leverage existing patterns for UI queries only
- **MANDATORY Agent Usage**: `appv2-integration-specialist` for Flask/SocketIO integration, `database-query-specialist` for all UI data access

Phase 4: Testing & Quality
Action 9: Frontend Testing
- Unit Tests: Tab switching, data formatting (use Jest or similar)
- Integration Tests: WebSocket communication with mocks
- Performance Tests: Load time and responsiveness (<1s, <200ms targets)
- E2E Tests: Browser workflows (e.g., add symbol → table update)
- Accessibility Tests: ARIA compliance, color contrast (reference ui_test_plan.md; include manual audits for screen readers)
- **MANDATORY Agent Usage**: `tickstock-test-specialist` for comprehensive test generation (auto-triggered), `integration-testing-specialist` for cross-system validation
Action 10: Sprint Completion
- Documentation Updates: Update ui_design_spec.md, front_end_implementation_guide.md with as-built changes; add user guides
- Performance Validation: Meet <1s, <200ms targets with 1000+ symbol simulation
- Quality Gates: 80% test coverage (align with ui_test_plan.md)
- Production Readiness: Full feature validation against user stories
- **MANDATORY Agent Usage**: `documentation-sync-specialist` for cross-reference updates, `architecture-validation-specialist` for final compliance check

🛠️ Technical Advantages
Existing Strengths to Leverage:
- GridStack Manager: Lines 2-348 provide complete layout system
- Theme Integration: Professional dark/light switching
- Connection Management: Status indicators and WebSocket handling
- Navigation Structure: Existing dashboard links and user settings
- JavaScript Architecture: Modular loading with core/events/gridstack
Implementation Benefits:
- Faster Development: 60% foundation already built, aligning with bootstrap philosophy (minimal deps)
- Consistent UX: Existing theme and navigation patterns
- Proven Stability: GridStack system already tested
- Performance Ready: WebSocket and caching infrastructure in place

📋 Immediate Next Steps
1. Replace Placeholder Content with Bootstrap tab structure (1-2 days)
2. Implement Dashboard Tab with watchlist functionality (2-3 days)
3. Add Chart.js Integration for OHLCV display (2 days)
4. Connect WebSocket Events for real-time updates (1-2 days)
5. Extend GridStack Layout for multi-panel drag/drop (2-3 days)
6. Conduct pre-validation with `architecture-validation-specialist` and relevant domain agents (1 day)

🔥 Dependencies/Risks
- Dependencies: Ensure Polygon/yfinance API keys ready for historical tests (from User Story 0.1); minimal new deps (stick to CDNs); queue agents early for consultations.
- Risks: WebSocket lag in high-volume—mitigate with throttling; API rate limits—add retries; agent unavailability—fallback to manual reviews. Monitor via existing monitoring tools; test synthetic vs. real data to validate blending prep.

🤖 Mandatory Agent Integration Workflow
**Pre-Implementation (REQUIRED)**:
1. `architecture-validation-specialist` - Validate approach compliance before any coding begins
2. Domain specialists based on auto-triggers (see Agent Auto-Triggers below)

**Agent Auto-Triggers (AUTOMATIC USAGE)**:
- **UI/Frontend work** → `appv2-integration-specialist` (Flask/SocketIO integration, WebSocket broadcasting)
- **Database queries** → `database-query-specialist` (read-only access, <50ms performance)  
- **Redis integration** → `redis-integration-specialist` (pub-sub patterns, loose coupling)
- **ANY code changes** → `tickstock-test-specialist` (comprehensive testing - MANDATORY)
- **Cross-system testing** → `integration-testing-specialist` (TickStockApp ↔ TickStockPL validation)
- **Documentation updates** → `documentation-sync-specialist` (cross-reference consistency)

**Agent Consultation Protocol**:
- Invoke via documented channels (e.g., specialist tools/docs); expect 1-2 day turnaround.
- Input: Share phase artifacts (code snippets, designs); Output: Approved revisions or blockers.
- If delayed: Proceed with peer review, flag in risks.

**Quality Gates (REQUIRED)**:
- Phase 3 completion requires `architecture-validation-specialist` + `redis-integration-specialist` approval
- Phase 4 completion requires `tickstock-test-specialist` + `integration-testing-specialist` validation
- Sprint completion requires `documentation-sync-specialist` + final architecture compliance check
