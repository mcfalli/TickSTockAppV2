## Definition of Done Statement

**Sprint 27 is considered DONE when:**

1. **Users can create sophisticated alert rules using visual interface**
2. **Alerts are delivered reliably via WebSocket and email within performance targets**
3. **Alert system integrates seamlessly with existing WebSocket and market context architecture**
4. **System handles 1000+ users with custom alert rules without performance degradation**
5. **Alert relevance is enhanced by market context and intelligent filtering**
6. **Users report that alerts improve their trading decision-making process**

**Acceptance Criteria**: The Product Owner can create complex alert rules (e.g., "Bull Flag patterns on AAPL above 0.7 confidence during Bull markets") and receive timely, relevant alerts via both WebSocket and email. The system maintains <100ms WebSocket delivery even with 100+ alerts per minute, and users can manage their alert history and performance analytics effectively.
