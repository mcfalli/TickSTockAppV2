  ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

  🚨 Priority 1: Core Universal WebSocket Manager

  Status: Must be implemented first in Week 1
  # These components are THE foundation - everything else depends on them:
  src/core/services/websocket_subscription_manager.py    # CRITICAL
  src/infrastructure/websocket/scalable_broadcaster.py   # CRITICAL
  src/infrastructure/websocket/event_router.py           # CRITICAL

  📈 Priority 2: Performance & Scalability Infrastructure

  Status: Required for 500+ user target
  - Connection pool management for horizontal scaling
  - User subscription indexing for <5ms event filtering
  - Batched broadcasting for efficient delivery
  - Comprehensive load testing framework

  🧪 Priority 3: Integration Testing Suite

  Status: Essential for production readiness
  - End-to-end TickStockPL → UI message flow validation
  - Redis failover and reconnection testing
  - User filtering accuracy and performance validation
  - Cross-browser WebSocket compatibility testing

  🎯 SUCCESS VALIDATION

  Non-Negotiable Success Criteria:

  1. Universal WebSocket Manager fully operational ✅ Ready for Sprints 26-30
  2. Performance targets achieved ✅ <5ms filtering, <100ms delivery, 500+ users
  3. Integration testing comprehensive ✅ End-to-end validation with TickStockPL
  4. Production readiness demonstrated ✅ Load testing and error recovery

  🚀 RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION

  Sprint 25 is APPROVED for implementation with the understanding that:

  Week 1 Focus: Implement Universal WebSocket Manager core

  Week 2 Focus: Build tier-specific integration and UI components

  Week 3 Focus: Performance validation and production readiness testing

  ⚡ Why Sprint 25 is Make-or-Break

  This sprint establishes the scalable real-time communication foundation that every subsequent feature depends on. Success here enables:
  - Sprint 26: Market insights with real-time ETF updates
  - Sprint 27: Instant pattern alerts via WebSocket
  - Sprint 28: Personalized recommendations with live updates
  - Sprint 29: Adaptive dashboard with real-time data
  - Sprint 30: Advanced analytics with live performance metrics

  Bottom Line: The documentation is excellent and implementation-ready. Sprint 25 success depends on flawless execution of the Universal WebSocket Manager as the scalable foundation for the        
  entire TickStockAppV2 enhancement program.
