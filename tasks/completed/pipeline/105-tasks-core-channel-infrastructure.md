# Sprint 105 Tasks: Core Channel Infrastructure

## Relevant Files

- `src/processing/channels/base_channel.py` - New abstract ProcessingChannel base class implementation
- `src/processing/channels/channel_router.py` - New DataChannelRouter implementation
- `src/processing/channels/channel_config.py` - New ChannelConfig and configuration management
- `src/processing/channels/channel_metrics.py` - New ChannelMetrics data structure and tracking
- `src/processing/channels/__init__.py` - Channel package initialization and exports
- `tests/unit/processing/channels/test_base_channel.py` - Unit tests for base channel class
- `tests/unit/processing/channels/test_channel_router.py` - Unit tests for channel router
- `tests/unit/processing/channels/test_channel_config.py` - Unit tests for configuration management
- `tests/unit/processing/channels/test_channel_metrics.py` - Unit tests for metrics collection
- `tests/integration/channels/test_multi_channel_processing.py` - Integration tests for channel system

### Notes

- This sprint implements the foundational infrastructure designed in Sprint 104
- All channel infrastructure must be async-compatible for high-throughput scenarios
- Unit tests should achieve 90% coverage for all new channel components
- Integration tests should validate concurrent multi-channel processing
