## What Is This Sprint About?

Sprint 40 focuses on **verifying and testing** the Live Streaming dashboard that was partially implemented in Sprint 33 Phase 5. This is NOT about building new features - it's about confirming what exists works 100% reliably.

### The Live Streaming Page

**Location**: Sidebar Navigation ‚Üí "Live Streaming" section
**Purpose**: Real-time display of streaming market data from TickStockPL

**Features to Verify**:
- ‚úÖ Session status indicator (active/inactive)
- ‚úÖ 4 core metrics: Active Symbols, Events/Second, Patterns Detected, Indicator Alerts
- ‚úÖ Real-time pattern detection stream
- ‚úÖ Indicator alerts stream
- ‚úÖ System health monitoring
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh capability

---

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ What EXISTS
- Frontend: `web/static/js/services/streaming-dashboard.js` (StreamingDashboardService)
- Sidebar integration: Line 53-60 in `sidebar-navigation-controller.js`
- Backend: `src/api/streaming_routes.py` (likely), `src/core/services/redis_event_subscriber.py`
- Database tables: `streaming_sessions`, `intraday_patterns`, `intraday_indicators`, `streaming_health_metrics`
- Redis channels: 8 channels defined for streaming events

### ‚ùå What's MISSING or UNKNOWN
- **Testing**: No comprehensive test coverage
- **TickStockPL Integration**: Unknown if streaming services are publishing events
- **Production Validation**: Not confirmed to work during market hours
- **Duplicate Template**: `web/templates/dashboard/streaming.html` should be removed

---

## Key Dependencies

### Critical Path Items

1. **TickStockPL Streaming Services** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - Must be operational during market hours
   - Must publish to all 8 Redis channels
   - Must meet performance targets (<100ms latency)
   - **Action**: Send `TICKSTOCKPL_REQUIREMENTS.md` ASAP

2. **Redis Pub/Sub Infrastructure** üü° MEDIUM
   - Already operational (verified in Sprint 33)
   - Need to confirm all 8 channels subscribed

3. **Database Access** üü¢ LOW
   - Read-only queries to TickStockPL tables
   - Already configured (verified in Sprint 33)

---

## Success Criteria

Sprint 40 is **COMPLETE** when:

1. ‚úÖ Live Streaming page loads without errors
2. ‚úÖ All 4 metrics display correctly
3. ‚úÖ Real-time patterns update via WebSocket
4. ‚úÖ Real-time indicators/alerts display
5. ‚úÖ System health accurate and updating
6. ‚úÖ Integration tests pass (95%+ coverage)
7. ‚úÖ Manual testing complete (100% scenarios)
8. ‚úÖ Performance targets met (<100ms end-to-end)
9. ‚úÖ Documentation complete
10. ‚úÖ Production-ready (no critical bugs)

---

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Tests
- Redis event subscriber
- API routes
- WebSocket emitters
- Frontend service logic

### 2. Integration Tests
- End-to-end event flow (Redis ‚Üí Browser)
- All 8 event types
- Batch events
- Error recovery

### 3. Manual Testing
- Pre-market (before 9:30 AM)
- Market open (9:30 AM)
- During market hours
- Market close (4:00 PM)
- Edge cases (high volume, errors, etc.)

### 4. Performance Testing
- Latency measurements
- Load testing (100+ events/sec)
- Concurrent users (10+ tabs)
- Memory leak detection

## Common Questions

### Q: What if TickStockPL isn't publishing events yet?
**A**: Use mock data! Create a Python script to publish test events to Redis channels. See `QUICKSTART_CHECKLIST.md` section 7 for example.

### Q: Can I skip testing and just verify it loads?
**A**: NO! This sprint is specifically about comprehensive testing. The whole point is 100% confidence it works.

### Q: What if I find major bugs?
**A**: Document them, estimate fix time, and decide: fix now or defer to Sprint 41? If critical, fix now. If nice-to-have, defer.

### Q: Do I need to test during market hours?
**A**: Ideally YES for final validation. But use mock data for development/testing outside market hours.

### Q: What if performance is bad (<100ms target)?
**A**: Profile and optimize. If can't meet target, document why and what would be needed. Defer optimization if needed.

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **TickStockPL dependency** - Can't complete without their streaming services
   - Mitigation: Mock data, early communication

2. **Performance under load** - 1000+ events/second
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, event batching

### Medium Risk Items
1. **WebSocket stability** - Connection drops
   - Mitigation: Auto-reconnect logic, error handling

2. **Browser compatibility** - Different browsers
   - Mitigation: Test Chrome, Firefox, Edge

### Low Risk Items
1. **Theme conflicts** - Light/dark mode
   - Mitigation: CSS variable testing
