# Sprint 31: Outstanding Items and Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Ready for Check-in

## Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Fully functional at `/admin/monitoring`
2. **Redis Integration**: Subscriber connected to `tickstock:monitoring` channel
3. **Flask Application**: Running on port 5000 with PostgreSQL on port 5432
4. **Authentication**: Admin routes properly secured
5. **Real-Time Updates**: 5-second polling with JavaScript controller

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Testing
1. **Live Data Flow**: Need to verify with actual TickStockPL monitoring events
2. **Historical Data Import**: Redis job submission not yet tested
3. **Pattern Cache**: Cache integration needs validation
4. **Alert Lifecycle**: Full alert workflow needs testing
5. **Performance Under Load**: Multi-user scenarios not tested

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Complete Check-in
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Sprint 31: Complete monitoring dashboard implementation

- Implemented real-time monitoring dashboard consuming TickStockPL events
- Added Redis subscriber service for monitoring channel
- Created admin API endpoints for system health and alerts
- Built responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 and canvas gauges
- Fixed CSRF, routing, and database port issues
- 100% real data - no mocks or fake data"
```

### 2. Test Live Integration
Run the monitoring integration test to verify real data flow:
```bash
python scripts/testing/test_monitoring_integration.py
```

### 3. Verify TickStockPL Connection
Ensure TickStockPL is publishing monitoring events:
```bash
# In TickStockPL directory
python scripts/run_monitoring.py
```

### 4. Test Data Import
Submit a test job through the historical data page:
1. Navigate to `/admin/historical-data`
2. Submit a small symbol load (e.g., AAPL for 1 day)
3. Monitor job status updates
4. Verify TickStockPL receives the job

### 5. Validate Cache Operations
Check pattern cache is receiving updates:
```bash
# Check Redis for pattern cache entries
redis-cli
> KEYS pattern:*
> KEYS api_response:*
```

## Post Check-in Tasks

### Week 1 (Testing Phase)
- [ ] Run all Priority 1 tests from backlog.md
- [ ] Document any issues found
- [ ] Create bug fix tickets if needed
- [ ] Update test results in backlog.md

### Week 2 (Enhancement Phase)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket broadcasting (replace polling)
- [ ] Add time-series charts for historical data
- [ ] Implement email notifications for critical alerts
- [ ] Add database persistence for long-term metrics

### Week 3 (Production Prep)
- [ ] Complete security review
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Prepare production configuration

## Known Issues to Address

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
1. **RLock Warning**: "1 RLock(s) were not greened" - eventlet monkey patch timing
2. **Redis Timeout**: Occasional "Timeout reading from socket" - normal for pub/sub
3. **Fallback Pattern Detector**: Initialization error (non-critical feature)

### Configuration Items
1. **CORS Settings**: Currently allowing all origins (`*`) - needs restriction
2. **Secret Key**: Using dev key - needs production value
3. **Database Password**: Exposed in commits - needs rotation for production

## Architecture Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Storage**: In-memory for recent metrics
- **Updates**: Pull model via polling
- **Events**: Consumed from Redis pub/sub
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with admin decorator

### Future Improvements
- **Storage**: TimescaleDB for historical data
- **Updates**: WebSocket push for real-time
- **Events**: Add event replay capability
- **Authentication**: Add role-based access control

## Documentation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Sprint 31 completion summary
- Testing backlog with priorities
- Frontend developer instructions (from TickStockPL)
- Code inline documentation

### üìù Needs Creation
- Admin user guide for monitoring dashboard
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- API documentation for monitoring endpoints
- Deployment guide for production

## Development Environment

### Current Setup
- **Python**: 3.13
- **PostgreSQL**: Port 5432 (updated from 5433)
- **Redis**: Port 6379
- **Flask**: Running on port 5000
- **Environment**: DEVELOPMENT mode

### Required for Production
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS configuration
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx or similar
- **Process Manager**: systemd or supervisor
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation

## Team Communication

### For Development Team
1. Code is ready for check-in
2. All major features implemented
3. Testing backlog created
4. No breaking changes

### For QA Team
1. Test plan in backlog.md
2. Integration test script available
3. Manual testing guide needed
4. Performance baselines documented

### For DevOps Team
1. No new infrastructure requirements
2. Redis channel: `tickstock:monitoring`
3. Database: Uses existing connection
4. Configuration: Via environment variables

## Success Metrics
