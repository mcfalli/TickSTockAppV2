# Health Event Status Update

**Date**: October 7, 2025, 2:00 PM ET
**Sprint**: Sprint 40 - Live Streaming Integration
**Status**: ⚠️ **Health Monitor Initialized But Not Publishing**

---

## Current Situation

### ✅ **Good Progress - Initialization Complete**

TickStockPL Streaming now shows **full detailed initialization**:

```
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,150 - Starting TickStockPL Streaming Service...
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,154 - Redis connection established for streaming
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,186 - Database connection established for streaming
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,188 - Streaming scheduler started
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,278 - Starting streaming session e40d0164-92f0-4270-97e6-8768ce04788d
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,283 - StreamingHealthMonitor initialized for session e40d0164
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,321 - Loaded 60 symbols from universe key: market_leaders:top_500
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,321 - STREAMING: Using Redis data source (channel: tickstock:market:ticks)
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,321 - STREAMING: Redis tick subscriber started successfully
[TickStockPL Streaming] 2025-10-07 13:57:32,406 - STREAMING: Published session_started event ✅
```

**Key Components Initialized**:
- ✅ StreamingHealthMonitor created
- ✅ Health Check job scheduled (APScheduler)
- ✅ Session ID: `e40d0164-92f0-4270-97e6-8768ce04788d`
- ✅ Universe loaded: `market_leaders:top_500` (60 symbols)
- ✅ Redis tick subscriber active
- ✅ Session started event published successfully

---

## ❌ **Issue: Health Events Not Being Published**

### What's Missing

**Expected Log (Every 5-10 Seconds)**:
```
[TickStockPL Streaming] STREAMING-HEALTH: Published health update - Status: healthy, Active Symbols: 60, TPS: 15.2
```

**Actual**: Zero health event publication logs

### Evidence

**Search 1**: Health event publishing
```bash
grep "STREAMING-HEALTH\|health.*publish" temp_log.log
```
**Result**: No matches - health events NOT being published

**Search 2**: Health event receipt by TickStockAppV2
```bash
grep "Streaming health update" temp_log.log
```
**Result**: No matches - no events received (expected, since none published)

**Search 3**: TickStockAppV2 subscription status
```bash
grep "Channel subscribe: tickstock:streaming:health" temp_log.log
```
**Result**: ✅ **Found** - TickStockAppV2 is subscribed and waiting

## Root Cause Analysis

### Health Monitor Initialized But Not Started

**The Issue**: `StreamingHealthMonitor` was **initialized** but the **background publishing loop didn't start**.

**Comparison to Requirements**:

From `TICKSTOCKPL_HEALTH_EVENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (line 107-112):
```python
async def start(self):
    """Start health monitoring loop."""
    self.running = True
    while self.running:
        await self._publish_health()
        await asyncio.sleep(5.0)  # Publish every 5 seconds
```

**What's happening**:
1. ✅ `StreamingHealthMonitor` constructor called (line 363 in logs)
2. ❌ `.start()` method NOT called - no background loop started
3. ❌ No health events published to Redis

---

## Solution

### Required: Start Health Monitor Background Loop

**Location**: `src/services/streaming_scheduler.py` (or wherever streaming session starts)

**After health monitor initialization, add**:
```python
# Existing code (already working):
self.health_monitor = StreamingHealthMonitor(
    redis_client=self.redis_client,
    session_id=session_id
)
logger.info(f"StreamingHealthMonitor initialized for session {session_id}")

# MISSING CODE - Add this:
asyncio.create_task(self.health_monitor.start())
logger.info("STREAMING-HEALTH: Health publishing loop started, publishing every 5 seconds")
```

**Alternative** (if using threading instead of asyncio):
```python
import threading

# After health monitor initialization
health_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.health_monitor.start, daemon=True)
health_thread.start()
logger.info("STREAMING-HEALTH: Health publishing thread started")
```

---

## Testing After Fix

### Step 1: Restart TickStockPL Streaming Service

**Expected New Logs**:
```
[TickStockPL Streaming] StreamingHealthMonitor initialized for session e40d0164...
[TickStockPL Streaming] STREAMING-HEALTH: Health publishing loop started, publishing every 5 seconds
[TickStockPL Streaming] STREAMING-HEALTH: Published health update - Status: starting, Active Symbols: 0, TPS: 0.0
[TickStockPL Streaming] STREAMING-HEALTH: Published health update - Status: healthy, Active Symbols: 60, TPS: 15.2
```

### Step 2: Verify TickStockAppV2 Receives Events

**Check logs**:
```bash
grep "Streaming health update" temp_log.log
```

**Expected**:
```
[TickStockAppV2] REDIS-SUBSCRIBER: Streaming health update received - Status: healthy
```

### Step 3: Verify Dashboard Updates

**Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` → Live Streaming

**Before Fix**:
```
Status: UNKNOWN
Active Symbols: 0
Data Flow: 0 ticks/sec
```

**After Fix**:
```
Status: HEALTHY ✅
Active Symbols: 60
Data Flow: 15.2 ticks/sec
```

## APScheduler Health Check Job

**Note**: I see this in logs:
```
Added job "Streaming Health Check" to job store "default"
```

**Question for TickStockPL Developer**:
- Is this job meant to **publish** health events, or just **check** health?
- If it's for publishing, what's the schedule interval?
- Might this be the intended publishing mechanism?

**If using APScheduler for health publishing**:
```python
# Ensure job publishes to Redis
def streaming_health_check():
    """Publish health status to Redis."""
    health_event = {
        'type': 'streaming_health',
        'health': {
            'session_id': self.session_id,
            'status': self._get_status(),
            'active_symbols': self.get_active_symbol_count(),
            'ticks_per_second': self.get_tick_rate(),
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'
        },
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'
    }

    self.redis_client.publish('tickstock:streaming:health', json.dumps(health_event))
    logger.debug(f"STREAMING-HEALTH: Published via APScheduler - Status: {health_event['health']['status']}")

# Schedule job (already done, just verify it calls the right function)
scheduler.add_job(
    streaming_health_check,
    'interval',
    seconds=5,  # Publish every 5 seconds
    id='streaming_health_check'
)
```

## Summary

### Current State
- ✅ **TickStockPL Streaming**: Fully initialized, all components working
- ✅ **Health Monitor Object**: Created successfully
- ❌ **Health Publishing Loop**: Not started - no events published
- ✅ **TickStockAppV2**: Subscribed and waiting for events

### Required Action
**Start the health monitor background loop** after initialization

**Expected Time**: 5-10 minutes to add loop start code

### Success Criteria
1. ✅ Log shows: "STREAMING-HEALTH: Health publishing loop started"
2. ✅ Log shows health events every 5 seconds: "STREAMING-HEALTH: Published health update"
3. ✅ TickStockAppV2 logs: "Streaming health update received"
4. ✅ Dashboard shows: "Status: HEALTHY, Active Symbols: 60, Data Flow: >0"

**Status**: ⏳ **Ready for Quick Fix**
**Blocker**: Health publishing loop not started
**Impact**: Dashboard showing "UNKNOWN" instead of "HEALTHY"
