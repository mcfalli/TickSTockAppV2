# Router Reference Error Fix

## Issue Description
The `channel_router.py` file had reference errors when trying to import `ProcessingChannel` and `ChannelType` classes, causing issues with type annotations and circular imports.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Circular Import Dependencies**: Direct imports of `ProcessingChannel` from `base_channel.py` created circular dependency issues
2. **Asyncio Lock Creation**: The `ChannelLoadBalancer` was trying to create an `asyncio.Lock()` during module initialization, which fails when no event loop is running

## Solution Applied

### 1. TYPE_CHECKING Imports
Added proper TYPE_CHECKING imports to resolve forward references without causing circular imports:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Callable, Protocol, Tuple, TYPE_CHECKING

# Type-only imports to avoid circular dependencies  
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .base_channel import ProcessingChannel, ChannelType, ProcessingResult
    from src.core.domain.events.base import BaseEvent
```

### 2. Lazy Asyncio Lock Creation  
Fixed the asyncio lock initialization issue by implementing lazy creation:

```python
class ChannelLoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.channel_loads: Dict[str, int] = defaultdict(int)
        self.round_robin_indices: Dict[str, int] = defaultdict(int)
        self._lock = None  # Don't create lock until needed
    
    def _get_lock(self):
        """Lazily create asyncio lock when needed"""
        if self._lock is None:
            self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
        return self._lock
```

And updated the usage:
```python
# Before
async with self._lock:

# After  
async with self._get_lock():
```

### 3. Runtime Imports for Actual Usage
Kept the runtime imports inside methods where the actual classes are needed:

```python
def __init__(self, config: RouterConfig):
    # ... other initialization
    
    # Channel registry by type
    from .base_channel import ChannelType, ProcessingChannel
    self.channels: Dict[ChannelType, List[ProcessingChannel]] = {
        ChannelType.TICK: [],
        ChannelType.OHLCV: [],
        ChannelType.FMV: []
    }
```

## Validation Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Import errors for ProcessingChannel references
- ❌ Asyncio lock creation failures outside event loop
- ❌ Router instantiation failures

### After Fix  
- ✅ All imports work correctly
- ✅ Router instantiation successful  
- ✅ Type annotations resolve properly
- ✅ No circular import issues
- ✅ Can register channels without errors
- ✅ Performance tests still pass (64.7 items/sec)

## Test Results

```bash
Router Reference Validation Test
========================================
SUCCESS: Router imports working
SUCCESS: Router instantiation working  
Channel types available: [<ChannelType.TICK: 'tick'>, <ChannelType.OHLCV: 'ohlcv'>, <ChannelType.FMV: 'fmv'>]
Routing strategy: RoutingStrategy.HEALTH_BASED
Strategy changed to: RoutingStrategy.LOAD_BASED
Router stats available: 20 entries
SUCCESS: All router references resolved
VALIDATION: PASSED - No reference errors
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/processing/channels/channel_router.py`**:
   - Added `TYPE_CHECKING` import
   - Added type-only imports block  
   - Modified `ChannelLoadBalancer.__init__()` to use lazy lock creation
   - Added `_get_lock()` method for lazy initialization
   - Updated lock usage from `self._lock` to `self._get_lock()`

## Impact

- ✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **Performance**: No performance impact, tests still pass at 64.7 items/sec
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper type annotations now work correctly
- ✅ **Import Safety**: No more circular import issues
- ✅ **Runtime Safety**: No more asyncio lock creation outside event loop

## Best Practices Applied

1. **TYPE_CHECKING Pattern**: Industry standard for resolving circular imports in Python
2. **Lazy Initialization**: Defer expensive resource creation until actually needed
3. **Runtime Imports**: Import classes only when they're actually used, not at module level
4. **Error Prevention**: Avoid creating asyncio primitives outside of event loops

The fix ensures the router can be imported, instantiated, and used correctly while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics.
