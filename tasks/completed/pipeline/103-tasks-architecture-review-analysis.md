# Sprint 103 Tasks: Architecture Review & Analysis

## Relevant Files

- `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` - Existing pipeline documentation that serves as the foundation for analysis
- `src/processing/pipeline/event_processor.py` - Core event processing component requiring analysis for multi-channel integration
- `src/core/services/market_data_service.py` - Main service entry point needing refactor analysis
- `src/presentation/websocket/publisher.py` - WebSocket publisher requiring flow documentation
- `src/presentation/websocket/data_publisher.py` - Data publisher component in the event flow
- `src/core/services/config_manager.py` - Configuration management patterns to analyze
- `src/processing/queues/priority_manager.py` - Existing priority queue system to evaluate
- `src/core/domain/events/base.py` - Event format structures to document
- `src/presentation/converters/transport_models.py` - Event transport format analysis

### Notes

- The research focuses on documenting missing pieces of the architecture flow
- No unit tests are required for this documentation-focused sprint
- Output enhances existing `docs/new/process_tick_pipeline.md` rather than creating new files
