# Technical Debt Management Process

**Purpose**: Process guide for identifying, tracking, and resolving technical debt in TickStock  
**Audience**: Development teams, sprint planning, technical leads  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  

## Overview

Technical debt represents the implied cost of future rework due to choosing quick, suboptimal solutions instead of robust ones. For TickStock's real-time market data system, managing technical debt is crucial for maintaining sub-millisecond performance and system reliability.

## What Constitutes Technical Debt

### High Priority Debt
- **Performance Impact**: Code that affects sub-millisecond processing requirements
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Issues that could compromise data integrity or system security
- **Critical System Stability**: Problems that could cause event loss or system failures
- **Scalability Blockers**: Issues preventing system from handling 4,000+ tickers

### Medium Priority Debt
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Overly complex monitoring systems or test infrastructure
- **Code Quality Issues**: Anti-patterns like nested `hasattr` checks, initialization dependencies
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing or outdated documentation affecting maintainability
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Areas lacking adequate test coverage

### Low Priority Debt
- **Code Cleanup**: Refactoring for better readability without functional impact
- **Tool Optimization**: Performance improvements in development/testing tools
- **Minor Documentation**: Style guide updates or formatting improvements

---

## Identification Process

### During Development
1. **Code Reviews**: Identify suboptimal solutions implemented for time constraints
2. **Performance Analysis**: Note areas where performance could be improved
3. **Architecture Reviews**: Identify design decisions that may limit future flexibility
4. **Testing Gaps**: Areas where testing is incomplete or overly complex

### During Sprint Retrospectives
1. **Technical Challenges**: What technical issues slowed down development?
2. **Workaround Solutions**: What temporary fixes were implemented?
3. **Quality Concerns**: What areas of code concern the team?
4. **Tool/Process Issues**: What development processes could be improved?

### Proactive Monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor for degradation in system performance
- **Error Rates**: Track increases in error rates or exception frequency
- **Maintenance Time**: Areas requiring disproportionate maintenance effort
- **Developer Feedback**: Regular team input on problematic areas

## Documentation Process

### Technical Debt Entry Format
Use this format when adding entries to `tasks/technical-debt-backlog.md`:

```markdown
### [Descriptive Title]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]  
**Sprint:** [Sprint where identified]  
**Component:** [Affected system component]

**Issue:** [Clear description of the technical debt]

**Impact:**  
- [Specific impact on performance, maintainability, etc.]
- [Risk to system stability or development velocity]
- [Cost of not addressing the debt]

**Proposed Solution:**  
- [Specific steps to resolve the debt]
- [Alternative approaches if applicable]
- [Dependencies or prerequisites]

**Effort:** [Estimated time: hours, days, or sprints]  
**Dependencies:** [Other work that must be completed first]
```

### Required Information
- **Root Cause**: Why was the suboptimal solution chosen initially?
- **Current Impact**: How is this affecting the system now?
- **Future Risk**: What problems could this cause if not addressed?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know the debt is resolved?

## Prioritization Framework

### Priority Assessment Matrix

| Factor | High Priority | Medium Priority | Low Priority |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Performance Impact** | Affects sub-ms processing | Affects non-critical paths | No performance impact |
| **System Stability** | Could cause data loss | Could cause service degradation | Cosmetic issues only |
| **Development Velocity** | Blocks new features | Slows development | Minor inconvenience |
| **Maintenance Cost** | High ongoing cost | Moderate maintenance burden | Minimal maintenance impact |

### Sprint Planning Integration

#### Sprint Capacity Allocation
- **20% Rule**: Reserve 20% of sprint capacity for technical debt resolution
- **High Priority Debt**: Must be addressed within 2 sprints of identification
- **Critical Debt**: Address immediately, potentially stopping other work

#### Debt Selection Criteria
1. **Alignment**: Choose debt that aligns with current sprint goals
2. **Dependencies**: Address debt that blocks upcoming features
3. **Learning Opportunities**: Use debt resolution for team skill development
4. **Quick Wins**: Include some low-effort, high-impact improvements

## Resolution Process

### Planning Phase
1. **Impact Analysis**: Understand full scope of changes required
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential breaking changes or performance impacts
3. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing approach
4. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare rollback strategy for critical changes

### Implementation Phase
1. **Feature Branch**: Create dedicated branch for debt resolution
2. **Incremental Changes**: Break large debt resolution into smaller commits
3. **Continuous Testing**: Run full test suite after each significant change
4. **Performance Validation**: Verify no performance regression introduced

### Validation Phase
1. **Code Review**: Thorough review focusing on the resolved technical debt
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance meets or exceeds previous benchmarks
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure changes don't break system integration
4. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation and architectural decisions

### Completion Phase
1. **Backlog Update**: Mark debt as resolved in technical-debt-backlog.md
2. **Metrics Update**: Record resolution time and effort for future estimation
3. **Team Communication**: Share lessons learned with development team
4. **Process Improvement**: Update this process based on lessons learned

## Monitoring and Tracking

### Metrics to Track
- **Debt Accumulation Rate**: New debt items per sprint
- **Debt Resolution Rate**: Resolved debt items per sprint
- **Resolution Time**: Average time from identification to resolution
- **Impact Metrics**: Performance improvements, reduced error rates, faster development

### Regular Reviews
- **Weekly**: Review high-priority debt during sprint planning
- **Monthly**: Assess overall debt trends and prioritization effectiveness
- **Quarterly**: Review and update technical debt management process
- **Post-Sprint**: Document new debt identified during sprint retrospectives

### Warning Indicators
- **Debt Accumulation > Resolution**: More debt being created than resolved
- **Critical Debt Aging**: High-priority debt remaining unresolved > 2 sprints
- **Developer Complaints**: Team reporting increasing friction in development
- **Performance Degradation**: System metrics showing declining performance

## Integration with Development Process

### Code Review Guidelines
- **Flag Potential Debt**: Reviewers should identify and flag potential technical debt
- **Document Decisions**: Comment on why suboptimal solutions are accepted
- **Suggest Improvements**: Provide specific suggestions for future improvement
- **Create Backlog Items**: Convert review comments into backlog entries when appropriate

### Sprint Planning Process
1. **Review Current Debt**: Start planning by reviewing current technical debt
2. **Assess Sprint Capacity**: Allocate 20% capacity for debt resolution
3. **Select Debt Items**: Choose debt aligned with sprint goals
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor debt resolution progress throughout sprint

### Definition of Done
Include technical debt considerations in Definition of Done:
- [ ] No new high-priority technical debt introduced
- [ ] Existing debt in modified areas assessed and documented
- [ ] Performance impact of changes validated
- [ ] Documentation updated if architectural patterns changed
