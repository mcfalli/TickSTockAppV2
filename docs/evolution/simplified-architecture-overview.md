## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Tick Data Ingestion
```
Polygon WebSocket/Synthetic → TickData Objects → Market Data Service
```

### 2. Redis Publishing (TickStockPL Integration)
```
TickData → Redis Message Format → Redis Channels:
  - tickstock.all_ticks (all data)
  - tickstock.ticks.{TICKER} (per ticker)
```

### 3. WebSocket Emission
```
Redis Events → WebSocket Publisher → SocketIO → Browser Clients
```

### 4. User Management
```
Client Connect → User Registration → Subscription Management → Filtered Events
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- **KISS Principle**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced external dependency complexity

### 2. Redis-Centric Integration
- **Pub-Sub Architecture**: Clean separation between TickStock and TickStockPL
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time data distribution via Redis
- **Scalability**: Redis enables horizontal scaling

### 3. Performance Focused
- **Memory-First Processing**: All operations in memory for speed
- **Minimal Layers**: Reduced processing overhead
- **Direct Data Flow**: Eliminated unnecessary transformations

### 4. Maintainability
- **Clean Code Structure**: Simplified file organization
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined component boundaries
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging for debugging

## Configuration Management
