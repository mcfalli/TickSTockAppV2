## ✅ Completed User Stories

### Sprint 14: Data Load & Maintenance

#### Story 0.1: Historical Data Loading for Subset of Stocks ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED in Sprint 14  
**As a** data analyst or backtester  
**I want to** load actual historical OHLCV data for selected stocks from reliable APIs

## 🚀 Core Pattern Detection Stories (Priority: High)

### Story 1: Real-Time Doji Pattern Detection
**As a** trader  
**I want to** detect Doji patterns in real-time on 1min data  
**So that** I can get alerts for potential reversals

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Process incoming 1min OHLCV via WebSockets
- Run Doji detection with tolerance parameters
- Publish events within 50ms latency
- Display alerts in UI with symbol, timestamp, price

**Components**: RealTimeScanner, EventPublisher, Redis pub-sub  
**Edge Cases**: Zero-range candles, low-volume bars  
**Priority**: HIGH - Quick-win validation pattern

### Story 3: Blended Historical + Live Data Scanning
**As an** analyst  
**I want** unified historical + live data for pattern scans  
**So that** patterns like Head & Shoulders work across timeframes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- DataBlender concatenates DB historical with WebSocket feeds
- Resample to target timeframe (e.g., daily)
- Unified DataFrame without gaps or duplicates
- Handle timezone consistency (UTC)

**Components**: HistoricalLoader, DataBlender, aggregator.py  
**Priority**: HIGH - Foundation for multi-bar patterns

- Load historical data over date ranges
- Output metrics (win rate, ROI) via pandas
- Integrate with PatternScanner batch mode
- Simulate slippage and commissions

**Components**: HistoricalLoader, metrics.py, visuals.py  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Validation capability

### Story 5: Customizable Pattern Parameters
**As a** trader  
**I want** customizable parameters for patterns  
**So that** I can tune tolerances based on market conditions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each pattern accepts params dict (e.g., {'shadow_ratio': 2.5})
- UI allows per-user overrides
- Persist preferences to database
- Dynamic parameter validation

**Priority**: MEDIUM - User personalization

- Include: pattern, symbol, price, timeframe, direction, confidence
- User-configurable filters (pattern type, watchlist)
- Handle high-volume (1000+ symbols) without lag

**Components**: EventPublisher, Redis pub-sub, WebSocket  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - User engagement feature

### Story 1.2: Multi-Day Pattern Alerts
**As a** swing trader  
**I want** alerts for multi-day patterns
