# Technical Debt Backlog

## Sprint 108 Additions

### Test Infrastructure Complexity
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** 108  

**Issue:** Sprint 108 introduced comprehensive test infrastructure with significant complexity for performance and integration testing.

**Impact:**  
- High maintenance overhead for complex test scenarios
- Extended test execution times (especially performance tests)
- Potential test flakiness with timing-dependent performance tests
- Higher compute requirements for CI/CD pipeline

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Optimize performance tests for faster execution while maintaining accuracy
- Implement test result caching for stable components
- Add test parallelization where possible
- Create lighter-weight smoke tests for quick validation

**Effort:** 1-2 sprints  

### Monitoring System Complexity
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** 108  

**Issue:** New ChannelMonitor system adds another layer of monitoring complexity alongside existing systems.

**Impact:**  
- Multiple monitoring systems to maintain (existing + channel-specific)
- Potential for conflicting or duplicate metrics
- Learning curve for operations team
- Risk of alert fatigue if thresholds not properly tuned

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Consolidate monitoring systems into unified observability platform
- Standardize alerting thresholds across all monitoring systems
- Create unified dashboard for all system metrics
- Implement intelligent alert correlation and deduplication

**Effort:** 2-3 sprints  

### Performance Test Maintenance
**Priority:** Low  
**Sprint:** 108  

**Issue:** Performance tests are sensitive to environment variations and may require ongoing tuning.

**Impact:**  
- Performance tests may fail in different environments
- Thresholds may need adjustment as system evolves
- Risk of false positives blocking deployments
- Difficulty reproducing performance issues locally

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Implement environment-aware performance thresholds
- Add performance test result trending and analysis
- Create performance test debugging tools
- Establish performance baseline management

**Effort:** 1 sprint  

### System Integration Coordination Overhead
**Priority:** Low  
**Sprint:** 108  

**Issue:** MultiChannelSystem orchestrator adds coordination overhead between components.

**Impact:**  
- Additional latency from coordination layer
- Complex initialization and shutdown sequencing
- Potential single point of failure
- Debugging complexity for multi-component issues

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Optimize coordination pathways for minimal latency
- Implement component isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Add advanced debugging and tracing capabilities
- Consider more distributed coordination patterns

**Effort:** 2-3 sprints  

## Sprint 107 Additions

### Code Complexity Debt
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** 107  

**Issue:** Sprint 107 introduced dual processing pathways (existing + multi-source) which increases code complexity.

**Impact:**  
- Maintenance overhead for two processing paths
- Potential confusion for new developers
- Testing complexity for both pathways

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Sprint 110+: Consolidate to single pathway once multi-source is fully validated
- Create comprehensive documentation for both pathways
- Add architectural decision documentation

**Effort:** 2-3 sprints  

### Performance Monitoring Integration
**Priority:** Low  
**Sprint:** 107  

**Issue:** Multiple performance monitoring systems (EventProcessor stats, source context stats, rules engine metrics, coordination stats) could be consolidated.

**Impact:**  
- Scattered performance metrics
- Potential duplicate data collection
- Complex performance analysis

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Create unified performance monitoring dashboard
- Consolidate metrics collection
- Standardize performance reporting format

**Effort:** 1 sprint  

### Configuration Management
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** 107  

**Issue:** Source-specific rules and coordination settings are code-based rather than configuration-based.

**Impact:**  
- Rules changes require code deployment
- Difficult to tune in production
- Limited A/B testing capabilities

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Move rules to external configuration
- Implement runtime rule modification
- Add configuration validation

**Effort:** 2 sprints  

## Existing Technical Debt

### Legacy Event Processing
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** Pre-107  

**Issue:** Some event processing logic still uses older patterns that could be modernized.

**Status:** Partially addressed in Sprint 107  
**Remaining Work:**  
- Complete migration to typed event models
- Standardize event validation patterns
- Consolidate event routing logic

### Database Integration Patterns
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** Pre-107  

**Issue:** Inconsistent database access patterns across the codebase.

**Status:** Not addressed in Sprint 107  
**Impact:** Continues to affect maintainability

### Testing Infrastructure
**Priority:** Low  
**Sprint:** Pre-107  

**Issue:** Test infrastructure could be more standardized.

**Status:** Improved in Sprint 107 with comprehensive test suite  
**Remaining Work:**
